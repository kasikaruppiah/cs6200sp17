The valuable information to be got from a website is usually found in links with shallow depths. Depth First Search algorithm continues with a branch from the seed url until it reaches the leaf node and hence it ends up producing low quality results. On the contrary Breadth First Search is optimal and produces better results, but consumes a lot of memory to store all child links at each level.

Breadth First Search:
	URL's Crawled: 434 
	Top 5:
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_heating
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_photovoltaics
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_thermal

Depth First Search:
	URL's Crawled: 251
	Top 5:
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Energy_(journal)
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_heating
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_constant

From the above result its evident that the depth first search traverses lesser link since we've coupled it with depth. And also the quality of links relevant to the seed url is better in breadth first search.
