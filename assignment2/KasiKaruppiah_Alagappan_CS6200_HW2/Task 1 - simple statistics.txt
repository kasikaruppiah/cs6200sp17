In Task 1, a brief report on simple statistics over G1 and G2 including for both graphs: (a) the proportion of: (a) pages with no in-­links (sources), (b) pages with no out-­links (sinks)

Both the graphs have 0 pages with no in-links (sources), as for a page to be present in the in-links graph it should have atleast 1 other source with link to the page in question

G1 :
	a) Proportion of pages with no in-links (sources) = 0
	b) Proportion of pages with no out-links (sinks) = 0

G2 :
	a) Proportion of pages with no in-links (sources) = 0
	b) Proportion of pages with no out-links (sinks) = 0.36
