The pagerank of a page is dependant on the quantity and pagerank quality of pages that links to the page.

The higher the pagerank of the in-links to the page and fewer out-links from the page, the more the pagerank of the page. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.

Hence the pagerank of a page can be completely different from the order of the in-links to the page. A page with more in-links like Uranium can have higher pagerank than International_Standard_Book_Number because the quality of the links pointing to Uranium have high pagerank than that of International_Standard_Book_Number. Similar is the case with other pages in the top 5 pages by pagerank order.
