Use ScoreDoc to write the document id and score of top 100 results into a file in the same directory of HW4.java and display the result as well. Repeat the same until encountering "q"

Task2
From the input token directory an word unigram inverted index is created.
For each term in the query string a bm25 score is computed and added to the document bm25 score.
