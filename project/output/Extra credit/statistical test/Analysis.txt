1) Taking BM25 as the baseline and comparing other search engines with it,
we get the following results

Search Engine A   -    Search Search B      :   pval

bm25_base         -    bm25_stopping       : 0.341159711048
bm25_base         -    bm25_thesaurus      : 0.000333513523361
bm25_base         -    lucene              : 0.0385870730652
bm25_base         -    tfidf_base          : 0.00112928838498
bm25_base         -    tfidf_stopping      : 0.0146453800291
bm25_base         -    tfidf_thesaurus     : 3.79309154248e-10

2) The Null-Hypothesis is rejected if the p-value is less than alpha, which is 
typically 0.05 for T-tests. Thus, if pval< 0.05, the results from the 2 searches is 
significantly different and one of the algorithms is significantly better than the other.

Now we have 4 pval values that are less than 0.05:

bm25_base         -    bm25_thesaurus      : 0.000333513523361
bm25_base         -    lucene              : 0.0385870730652
bm25_base         -    tfidf_base          : 0.00112928838498
bm25_base         -    tfidf_stopping      : 0.0146453800291

We can conclude that the Null-Hypothesis for these 4 comparisons is false, which
means either these search algorithms are much better or much worse than BM25 and 
the difference is not worth neglecting.

Now we compare the MAP (Mean Average Precision) of these algorithms with the MAP of
our baseline BM25

Run                 Mean Average Precision
BM25                    0.198
bm25_thesaurus          0.118
TFIDF                   0.130   
TFIDF_Stopping          0.149
Lucene                  0.159

So as we see, the MAP of BM25 baseline is highest among these. Which means that 
BM25 is significantly better than all of these search algorithms.

As, a side point we can see that bm25_stopping has a higher MAP than BM25 baseline
but its p-value for T-test is not < 0.05. 

Run                 Mean Average Precision
BM25                    0.198
BM25_Stopping           0.208


Which means that it is better than the BM25
baseline but not significantly better.
