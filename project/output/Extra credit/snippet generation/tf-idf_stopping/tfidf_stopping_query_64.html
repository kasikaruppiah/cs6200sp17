A  Nonrecursive <b>List</b> Compacting Algorithm 

A simple nonrecursive <b>list</b> structure compacting scheme or garbage 
collector suitable for both compact <b>and</b> LISP-like <b>list</b> structures is presented<br><br><u><b>CACM-0527.html</b></u><br>



The Description <b>List</b> of Concepts

A concept is defined <b>as</b> a class of objects
whose members can <b>be</b> distinguished by processing 
its properties<br><br><u><b>CACM-2651.html</b></u><br>



The Treatment of Data Types in <b>EL1</b>

In constructing a general purpose programming
language, a key issue is providing a sufficient 
set of data types <b>and</b> associated operations in a manner
that permits both natural problem-oriented notation 
<b>and</b> efficient implementation<br><br><u><b>CACM-1853.html</b></u><br>  The system garbage collector
attempts to make <b>all</b> lists compact; <b>it</b> relocates 
<b>and</b> rearranges <b>all</b> of <b>list</b> storage using temporary storage<br><br><u><b>CACM-1424.html</b></u><br>



Automatic Analysis of Electronic Digital Circuits Using <b>List</b> Processing

A mapping from black diagrams of digital circuits
to <b>list</b> structures is described, together 
with a <b>list</b> processing program written for the Control
Data 3600 which uses this mapping to automatically 
carry out circuit analysis<br><br><u><b>CACM-2855.html</b></u><br>  The 
original <b>list</b> is destroyed <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is moved<br><br><u><b>CACM-1549.html</b></u><br>  The routine for implementing 
this algorithm can <b>be</b> written in the <b>list</b> language with
which <b>it</b> is to <b>be</b> used, thus insuring a degree 
of machine independence<br><br><u><b>CACM-2772.html</b></u><br>  Opportunity

conditions for the existence of a solution<br><br><u><b>CACM-1957.html</b></u><br>  The <b>list</b> set generator is
a construct which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> added to a <b>list</b> processing system or any
system that handles sets<br><br>
