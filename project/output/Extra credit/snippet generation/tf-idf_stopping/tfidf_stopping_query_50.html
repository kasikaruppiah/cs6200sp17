The Use of Normal Multiplication Tables
for <b>Information</b> Storage and <b>Retrieval</b>

This paper describes a method for the organization and <b>retrieval</b> of attribute

for the <b>information</b> system<br><br><u><b>CACM-3075.html</b></u><br>



Fast <b>Parallel</b> Sorting Algorithms

A <b>parallel</b> bucket-sort algorithm is presented
that requires time O(log n) and the use of n

Experimental Evaluation of <b>Information</b>
<b>Retrieval</b> Through a Teletypewriter

Experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities
of mechanized <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> systems, 
with emphasis on interactive (man-machine) language and on
some of the mechanical and psychological limitations 
<b>in</b> their design, were conducted at the Moore School <b>information</b>
