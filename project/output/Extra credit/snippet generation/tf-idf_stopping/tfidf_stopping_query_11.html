Automatic Data Structure Choice in a Language of <b>Very</b> <b>High</b> <b>Level</b>

<b>SETL</b> is a set-theoretically oriented language
of <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> whose repertoire of semantic

CONVERT: A <b>High</b> <b>Level</b> Translation
Definition Language for Data Conversion

This paper describes a <b>high</b> <b>level</b> and nonprocedural
translation definition language, CONVERT, 
which provides <b>very</b> powerful and highly flexible data
restructuring capabilities<br><br><u><b>CACM-3150.html</b></u><br>  Just
as <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>languages</b> enabled the programmer to escape from the
intricacies of a machine's order code, higher <b>level</b> programming systems
can provide the means to understand and manipulate complex
systems and components<br><br><u><b>CACM-3171.html</b></u><br>
