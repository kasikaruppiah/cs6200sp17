Further Evidence for the Analysis of <b>Algorithms</b>
for the Zero-One Programming Problem

The purpose of this note is to report <b>computational</b>
experience additional to that recently 
summarized by Gue et al, with two <b>algorithms</b> for the
zero-one linear programming problem<br><br><u><b>CACM-2927.html</b></u><br>  Use of preprocessing techniques
involving space-time <b>and</b> additive-multiplicative 
tradeoffs reduces this upper bound to O(N/log logN)
<b>and</b> the bit <b>complexity</b> to O(N logN log log logN)<br><br><u><b>CACM-0895.html</b></u><br>



A <b>Computational</b> Extension of the Variate Difference Method

Presented here is a <b>computational</b> extension
of the variate difference method as developed by 
G<br><br><u><b>CACM-2997.html</b></u><br>  The presented <b>algorithms</b> use the "divide
<b>and</b> conquer" technique <b>and</b> recursively apply 
a merge procedure for two nonin tersecting convex hulls<br><br><u><b>CACM-3166.html</b></u><br>  Two of the <b>algorithms</b> are well-known in the statistical
<b>and</b> <b>computational</b> literature; the other two are new <b>algorithms</b>
specifically intended for automatic computation<br><br>
