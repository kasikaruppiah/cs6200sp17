A Case Study <b>in</b> Programming for <b>Parallel</b>-Processors

An affirmative partial answer is provided to
the question of whether it is possible to program 
<b>parallel</b>-<b>processor</b> computing systems to efficiently decrease
execution time for useful problems<br><br><u><b>CACM-2288.html</b></u><br>  Some important theorems on
the consecutive retrieval property are proved <b>in</b>

Tan, K<br><br><u><b>CACM-0891.html</b></u><br>  Further,the
method of solution makes it possible for 
many groups who have previously dismissed an information
retrieval program as expensive and difficult 
(from a programming stand-point) to reconsider their position,
for the present solution makes it possible 
to install an information retrieval program <b>in</b> less than
three months, and with relatively little equipment<br><br><u><b>CACM-1457.html</b></u><br>  The main data

systems are first briefly reviewed<br><br><u><b>CACM-2664.html</b></u><br>
