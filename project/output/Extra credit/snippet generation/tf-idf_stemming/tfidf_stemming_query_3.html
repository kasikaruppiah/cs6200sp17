Parallelism in Tape-Sorting

Two methods for employing parallelism in tape-sorting
are presented<br><br><u><b>CACM-2714.html</b></u><br>  These performances compare very favorably with
the previous best <b>parallel</b> merging <b>algorithm</b>, 
Batcher's <b>algorithm</b>, which requires n/p + ((m+n)/2p)log2 m
steps in the general case and km/p + ((k+1)/2)(m/p)log2 
m in the special case where n=km<br><br><u><b>CACM-2973.html</b></u><br>

Some Thoughts on <b>Parallel</b> Processing

CACM October, 1960

Yarbrough, L<br><br><u><b>CACM-1262.html</b></u><br>  These serve partly as brackets in establishing
a range of <b>parallel</b> operation and partly to 
define each <b>parallel</b> path within this range<br><br><u><b>CACM-0950.html</b></u><br>



<b>Parallel</b> Methods for Integrating Ordinary Differential Equations

This paper is dedicated to the proposition that,
in order to take full advantage for real-time 
computations of highly <b>parallel</b> computers as can be
expected to be available in the near future, much 
of numerical analysis will have to be recast in a more
"<b>parallel</b>" form<br><br><u><b>CACM-1302.html</b></u><br>

A Highly <b>Parallel</b> <b>Algorithm</b> for Approximating
All Zeros of a Polynomial with Only Real Zeros

An <b>algorithm</b> is described based on Newton's
method which simultaneously approximates all zeros 
of a polynomial with only real zeros<br><br><u><b>CACM-2685.html</b></u><br>
