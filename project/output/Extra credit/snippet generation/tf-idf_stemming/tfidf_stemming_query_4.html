Use of the LRU Stack Depth Distribution
for Simulation of Paging Behavior

Two families of probability distributions were
needed for use by a virtual memory simulation 
model: headway between page fault distributions, <b>and</b>
working set size distributions<br><br><u><b>CACM-1778.html</b></u><br>
