Cost/Utilization: A Measure <b>of</b> <b>System</b> Performance

A method is presented for evaluating computer
<b>system</b> performance in terms <b>of</b> a cost/utilization 
factor <b>and</b> a measure <b>of</b> imbalance<br><br><u><b>CACM-3048.html</b></u><br>  Simulation <b>of</b> the
<b>system</b> <b>model</b> yields the timing <b>and</b> resource usage 
statistics needed for performance evaluation, without
the necessity <b>of</b> emulating the <b>system</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-3070.html</b></u><br>  The accuracy <b>and</b> efficiency <b>of</b> the
hybrid technique are demonstrated by comparing 
the result <b>and</b> computational costs <b>of</b> the hybrid <b>model</b> <b>of</b>
the example with those <b>of</b> an equivalent simulation-only 
<b>model</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-1344.html</b></u><br>



Statistical Computations Based Upon Algebraically Specified Models

Based upon a machine-readable statistical <b>model</b>
<b>and</b> related symbolic specifications, an efficient 
method <b>of</b> performing calculations for statistical models
<b>of</b> a balanced complete nature is presented<br><br><u><b>CACM-3089.html</b></u><br>



Performance <b>of</b> Rollback Recovery Systems under Intermittent Failures

A mathematical <b>model</b> <b>of</b> a transaction-oriented
<b>system</b> under intermittent failures is proposed<br><br><u><b>CACM-1653.html</b></u><br>



<b>System</b> Performance Evaluation: Survey <b>and</b> Appraisal

The state <b>of</b> the art <b>of</b> <b>system</b> performance
evaluation is reviewed <b>and</b> evaluation goals <b>and</b> 
problems are examined<br><br><u><b>CACM-2542.html</b></u><br>



A Software Design <b>and</b> Evaluation <b>System</b>

A critical failure <b>of</b> current software <b>system</b>
design <b>and</b> implementation methodology is that 
the performance <b>of</b> a proposed design is not evaluated
before it is actually implemented<br><br><u><b>CACM-1938.html</b></u><br>  It is each terminal user's ability
to utilize the full resources <b>of</b> the <b>system</b> that 
makes quantitative evaluation <b>of</b> time-sharing systems
particularly difficult<br><br><u><b>CACM-3136.html</b></u><br> computer market have been developed to study 
the relationships between <b>system</b> price <b>and</b> hardware performance<br><br>
