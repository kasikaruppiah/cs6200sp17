A Queuing Model of a Multiprogrammed
Computer <b>with</b> a Two-Level Storage <b>System</b>

The results are presented of an analysis of
a probabilistic model of a multiprogrammed computer 
<b>system</b> <b>with</b> a two-level storage <b>system</b> in which there
is sequential dependency of accesses between the 
devices<br><br><u><b>CACM-2319.html</b></u><br>  Because of the
severe interactions between the various subsystems 
of an operating <b>system</b>, an overall model of the <b>total</b>
<b>system</b> must be developed <b>to</b> be able <b>to</b> analyze 
<b>and</b> design the performance aspects of an operating <b>system</b>
although such <b>total</b> <b>system</b> designs are exceptional 
today, it is projected that they will become increasingly
more common <b>and</b> necessary in the near future<br><br><u><b>CACM-3002.html</b></u><br>  The probabilities of access
