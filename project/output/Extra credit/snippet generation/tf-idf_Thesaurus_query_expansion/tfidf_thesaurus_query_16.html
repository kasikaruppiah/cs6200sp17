Subroutine Assembly

A description is given <b>of</b> an assembly system,
which requires only one pass <b>and</b> does not maintain 
a table <b>of</b> information about the subroutine library<br><br><u><b>CACM-0479.html</b></u><br>  If the number 
<b>of</b> strings dispersed is between two levels acceptable
by Polyphase merge, a more economical technique 
<b>of</b> reaching the next level for Polyphase merge is shown <b>and</b> proved<br><br><u><b>CACM-1223.html</b></u><br>  The double scan, one <b>in</b> either direction, performed
by the first two passes, allows the compiler 
to remove locally constant expressions <b>and</b> recursively
calculable expressions from loops <b>and</b> to do the 
important part <b>of</b> common subexpression recognition<br><br><u><b>CACM-2080.html</b></u><br>



The Nucleus <b>of</b> a Multiprogramming System

This paper describes the philosophy <b>and</b> structure <b>of</b> a multiprogramming system 
that can be extended with a hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> to suit diverse 
requirements <b>of</b> program scheduling <b>and</b> resource allocation<br><br><u><b>CACM-1439.html</b></u><br>  The techniques developed
to accomplish the mechanization are largely 
empirical, <b>and</b> are dependent for their information
only <b>on</b> the actual data points<br><br><u><b>CACM-1613.html</b></u><br>  The 
algorithm is a variant <b>of</b> the so-called "top-down"
analysis technique, <b>and</b> requires only one pass <b>of</b> 
the input text<br><br><u><b>CACM-2309.html</b></u><br>
