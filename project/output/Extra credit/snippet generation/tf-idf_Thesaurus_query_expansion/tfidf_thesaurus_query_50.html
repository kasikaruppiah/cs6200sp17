One-Pass Compilation of Arithmetic Expressions for a <b>Parallel</b> Processor

Under the assumption that a processor may have
a multiplicity of arithmetic units, a compiler 
for such a processor should produce object code to take
advantage of possible parallelism of operation<br><br><u><b>CACM-1788.html</b></u><br> 
 <b>In</b> this paper, it is contended that a programming
language is best described functionally as a body 
of macro instructions, and that the macro call constitutes
a canonical form <b>in</b> terms of which a programming 
notation may be described<br><br><u><b>CACM-2386.html</b></u><br>

Analysis of an Algorithm for Real Time Garbage Collection

A real time garbage collection system avoids
suspending the operations of a list processor 
for the long times that garbage collection normally requires
by performing garbage collection on a second 
processor <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> with list processing operations,
or on a single processor time-shared with them<br><br>
