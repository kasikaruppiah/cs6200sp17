An Example in "Significant-Digit" Arithmetic*

Different methods of handling the summing process
for the geometric series are shown to give 
results indicating widely differing significances when carried
out in a machine incorporating "significant-digit" 
arithmetic<br><br><u><b>CACM-3191.html</b></u><br>



   Generating Permutations by Nested Cycling

   The purpose of this letter is two_fold: first to give due credit to the
Tompkins-Paige algorithm, <b>and</b> second to clarify a comment by Hill, CR Review

desirable to transform the argument to a short 
range symmetric about 10.<b>1</b> will give examples of this
usage for the square root <b>and</b> logarithm function 
for both binary <b>and</b> decimal machines<br><br><u><b>CACM-1015.html</b></u><br>  <b>As</b> a by-product, this method

that readability can <b>be</b> added automatically in 
the translation process so that the programmer can

Perturbations of Eigenvalues of Non-normal Matrices

The problem considered is to give bounds for finite
perturbations of simple <b>and</b> multiple eigenvalues 
of nonnormal matrices, where these bounds are in terms
of the eigenvalues, the departure from normality, 
<b>and</b> the Frobenius norm of the perturbation matrix, but
not in terms of the eigen system<br><br><u><b>CACM-1505.html</b></u><br>
