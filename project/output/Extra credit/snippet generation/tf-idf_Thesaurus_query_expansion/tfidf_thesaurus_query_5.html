<b>The</b> Reconstruction <b>of</b> Binary Patterns from Their Projections

Given <b>the</b> horizontal <b>and</b> vertical projections
<b>of</b> a finite binary pattern f, can we construct

<b>of</b> patterns that <b>are</b> reconstructable 
from their projection<br><br><u><b>CACM-2311.html</b></u><br>  For each generation,
