A System for Interprocess Communication
<b>in</b> a Resource Sharing Computer <b>Network</b>

A system of communication between processes <b>in</b> a
time-sharing system is described <b>and</b> the communication 
system is extended so that it may be used between processes
<b>distributed</b> throughout a computer <b>network</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-1685.html</b></u><br>
