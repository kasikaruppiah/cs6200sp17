<b>Code</b> Extension in ASCII* (An ASA Tutorial)

The American Standard <b>Code</b> <b>for</b> Information
Interchange (ASCII) contains a number of control 
characters associated with the principle of <b>code</b> extension,
that is, with the representation of information 
which cannot be directly represented by means of the characters
in the <b>Code</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-0048.html</b></u><br>
 A high degree of redundancy is used, permitting 
a single-error correcting <b>code</b> ("minimum-distance-three"
<b>code</b>) with 64 10-bit <b>code</b> words to be employed 
as the station identification <b>code</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2897.html</b></u><br>

produced by a compiler using the expansion-<b>optimization</b> 
strategy described above compares favorably with the

A Vector <b>Space</b> Model <b>for</b> Automatic Indexing

In a document retrieval, or other pattern matching
environment where stored entities (documents) 
are compared with each other or with incoming patterns
(search requests), it appears that the best indexing 
(property) <b>space</b> is one where each entity lies as far away
from the others as possible; in these circumstances 
the value of an indexing system may be expressible
as a function of the density of the object <b>space</b>; 
in particular, retrieval performance may correlate inversely
with <b>space</b> density<br><br><u><b>CACM-1655.html</b></u><br>
