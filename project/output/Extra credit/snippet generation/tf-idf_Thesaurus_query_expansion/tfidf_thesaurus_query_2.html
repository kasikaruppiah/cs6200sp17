Nth Roots of a Complex Number (Algorithm 53)

CACM July, 1961

Nestor Jr<br><br><u><b>CACM-0630.html</b></u><br>  This paper argues
that readability can be added automatically <b>in</b> 
the translation process so that the programmer can
enjoy the utmost economy of expression, while for 
management a full and valid COBOL version is printed to give
all the advantages of readability and compatibility<br><br><u><b>CACM-1282.html</b></u><br>



The Use of FORTRAN <b>in</b> Subroutines with COBOL Main Programs

<b>By</b> using the proper COBOL coding techniques and
accounting for differences <b>in</b> storage allocation 
and library routines between the two languages, it is
possible to write FORTRAN IV subroutines that may 
be called from COBOL main programs<br><br><u><b>CACM-0321.html</b></u><br>  However, experience has shown that 
once the report is explained it is <b>in</b> fact easy to learn
ALGOL and to write algorithms <b>in</b> it<br><br>
