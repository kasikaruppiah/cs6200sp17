Across Machine Lines in COBOL

The production <b>of</b> a large, file-maintenance-and-retrieval
program system written in COBOL is 
described<br><br><u><b>CACM-2560.html</b></u><br>



A Queuing Model <b>of</b> a Multiprogrammed
Computer with a Two-Level Storage System

The results are presented <b>of</b> an analysis <b>of</b>
a probabilistic model <b>of</b> a multiprogrammed computer 
system with a two-level storage system in which there
is sequential dependency <b>of</b> accesses between the 
devices<br><br><u><b>CACM-1657.html</b></u><br>



Implementation <b>of</b> the SHARER2 Time-Sharing System

A simple mechanism is described for the execution
<b>of</b> part <b>of</b> a program with its own <b>memory</b> 
protection<br><br><u><b>CACM-2984.html</b></u><br>



Cost/Utilization: A Measure <b>of</b> System Performance

A method is presented for evaluating computer
system performance in terms <b>of</b> a cost/utilization 
factor and a measure <b>of</b> imbalance<br><br><u><b>CACM-2371.html</b></u><br> 
 The hypothetical application <b>of</b> the system to an existing network is discussed<br><br><u><b>CACM-1304.html</b></u><br>



A Rapid Turnaround Multi-Programming System

In this paper, basic features, system characteristics
and the control algorithm for a multi-programming 
system with rapid turnaround time are described<br><br><u><b>CACM-1591.html</b></u><br>  In 
addition, the advantages <b>of</b> this type <b>of</b> system for computer
programming and operation are also considered<br><br><u><b>CACM-2955.html</b></u><br>



Buddy <b>Systems</b>

Two algorithms are presented for implementing
any <b>of</b> a class <b>of</b> buddy <b>systems</b> for dynamic storage 
allocation<br><br><u><b>CACM-1749.html</b></u><br>  The hierarchical structure proved 
to be vital for the verification <b>of</b> the logical soundness
<b>of</b> the design and the correctness <b>of</b> its implementation<br><br><u><b>CACM-2747.html</b></u><br>



A Simplified Recombination Scheme for the Fibonacci Buddy System

A simplified recombination scheme for the Fibonacci
buddy system which requires neither tables 
nor repetitive calculations and uses only two
additional bits per buffer is presented<br><br>
