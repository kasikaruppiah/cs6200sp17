The Structure of the "THE"-Multiprogramming System

A multiprogramming system <b>is</b> described in
which all activities are divided over a number of 
sequential processes<br><br><u><b>CACM-1657.html</b></u><br>  An improved version of the 
SHARER time-sharing system using this feature <b>is</b> described<br><br><u><b>CACM-2371.html</b></u><br>



A System for Interprocess Communication
in a Resource Sharing Computer Network

A system of communication between processes in a
time-sharing system <b>is</b> described and the communication 
system <b>is</b> extended so that it may be used between processes
distributed throughout a computer network<br><br><u><b>CACM-2955.html</b></u><br>

A Queuing Model of a Multiprogrammed
Computer with a Two-Level Storage System

The results are presented of an analysis of
a probabilistic model of a multiprogrammed computer 
system with a two-level storage system in which there
