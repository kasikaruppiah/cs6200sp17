A Position Paper on Computing and Communications

The effective operation <b>of</b> free enterprise in
creating the envisioned information service industry 
is dependent upon three accomplishments: (1) the restructuring
<b>of</b> our information processing industry 
so that a clear division <b>of</b> costs is made among computing,
communications, and the development <b>of</b> information 
services; (2) the wide use <b>of</b> multiaccess system concepts
so that information services may share in the 
use <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> installations and so that the cost <b>of</b> their
construction is reasonable; and (3) the development 
<b>of</b> public, message-switched communications services so
that adequate provisions are made for information 
security<br><br><u><b>CACM-2914.html</b></u><br>
