A Rapid Turnaround Multi-Programming System

<b>In</b> this paper, basic features, system characteristics
and the <b>control</b> algorithm for a multi-programming 
system with rapid turnaround time are described<br><br><u><b>CACM-2376.html</b></u><br>
 This is demonstrated for a system consisting of 
many sending processes which deposit messages <b>in</b> a buffer
and many receiving processes which remove messages 
from that buffer<br><br><u><b>CACM-2984.html</b></u><br>



Cost/Utilization: A Measure of System Performance

A method is presented for evaluating computer
system performance <b>in</b> terms of a cost/utilization 
factor and a measure of imbalance<br><br><u><b>CACM-1749.html</b></u><br>  These sequential processes are placed
at various hierarchical levels, <b>in</b> each 
of which one or more independent abstractions have been
implemented<br><br><u><b>CACM-1591.html</b></u><br>  The model transferred <b>control</b> to the
<b>operating</b> system to execute functions other than 
teaching, and then recovered <b>control</b> <b>in</b> order to resume
teaching<br><br><u><b>CACM-2629.html</b></u><br>  It offers
a number of features seldom found even <b>in</b> larger 
<b>operating</b> <b>systems</b>, including: (1) a hierarchical file system
incorporating demountable volumes; (2) compatible 
file, device, and inter-process I/O; (3) the ability to
initiate asynchronous processes; (4) system command 
language selectable on a per-user basis; and (5) over
100 subsystems including a dozen languageshis

file system and of the user command interface<br><br><u><b>CACM-1519.html</b></u><br>
