On the Automatic Simplification <b>of</b> <b>Computer</b> Programs

Presented in this paper is the problem <b>of</b> writing
a program which would examine any other program 
<b>and</b> perform such simplifications on it as can be detected
from the argument-program's form alone, without 
having any knowledge <b>of</b> what it is supposed to do<br><br><u><b>CACM-3152.html</b></u><br>  This also
makes possible the derivation <b>of</b> an asymptotically better bound
for multiplication <b>of</b> matrices given in row-oriented form <b>by</b> adapting
the technique <b>of</b> Strassen to the reorganized data<br><br>
