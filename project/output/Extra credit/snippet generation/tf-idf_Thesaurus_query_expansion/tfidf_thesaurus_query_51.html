<b>tf-idf</b><br><br>Query - <b>Parallel processors and paging algorithms</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2863.html</b></u><br> 
The results of simulating VMIN, Denning's working set,
<b>and</b> the page partitioning replacement <b>algorithms</b> 
on five virtual memory programs are presented to demonstrate
the improvement possible over the known 
realizable variable space <b>algorithms</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2668.html</b></u><br>  A first order Markov model of program 
behavior is assumed, <b>and</b> a representation of the system
based on memory states, control states, <b>and</b> memory 
substates is presented<br><br><u><b>CACM-1613.html</b></u><br>  The 
algorithm is a variant of the so-called "top-down"
analysis technique, <b>and</b> requires only one pass of 
the input text<br><br><u><b>CACM-0488.html</b></u><br>

CACM June, 1974

Page, R<br><br><u><b>CACM-1788.html</b></u><br>  Also discussed are the conflict between
machine independence <b>and</b> object program efficiency,

lie in compiler construction<br><br><u><b>CACM-3190.html</b></u><br>
