Linear Programming <b>Applied</b> to Ultraviolet Absorption Spectroscopy

CACM February, 1963

White, W<br><br><u><b>CACM-2342.html</b></u><br> 
 The formation of partial rules and the calculation of
transition rules are both applicable to hardware 
<b>processes</b> as well as to software <b>processes</b>, and
symmetry between <b>processes</b> is not required<br><br><u><b>CACM-0020.html</b></u><br>



Accelerating Convergence of Iterative <b>Processes</b>

A technique is discussed which, when <b>applied</b>
to an iterative procedure for the solution of
an equation, accelerates the rate of convergence if
the iteration converges and induces convergence if
the iteration diverges<br><br><u><b>CACM-2376.html</b></u><br>
