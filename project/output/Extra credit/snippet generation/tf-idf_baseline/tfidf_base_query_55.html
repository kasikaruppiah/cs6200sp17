<b>Regular</b> Expression Search Algorithm

A method for locating specific character strings
embedded in character text is described and 
an implementation <b>of</b> this method in the form <b>of</b> a compiler
is discussed<br><br><u><b>CACM-2650.html</b></u><br>



Order-n Correction for <b>Regular</b> <b>Languages</b>

A method is presented for calculating a string
B, belonging to a given <b>regular</b> language L, 
which is "nearest" (in number <b>of</b> edit operations) to a
given input string a<br><br><u><b>CACM-2921.html</b></u><br>  RRP grammars

Translation Equations

Input limited transduction <b>expressions</b>, <b>or</b> translation equations,
are used to describe the syntax and left-context sensitive semantics for 
context-free <b>languages</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-3064.html</b></u><br>  Additional features
and problems dealt <b>with</b> include the proper handling 
<b>of</b> simultaneous <b>events</b>; that certain <b>events</b> must be created,
scheduled, and executed at the same points 
in simulated time; that infinite loops caused by the concatenation
<b>of</b> such "zero-time" <b>events</b> are possible 
and must be diagnosed; that maintaining various event
counts is practical and economical; and that a 
capability for handling  "time-displaceable" <b>events</b> is desirable and possible<br><br><u><b>CACM-3056.html</b></u><br>  An
example is given in which 8-bit counters (bytes) 
are used to keep track <b>of</b> as many as 130,000 <b>events</b> <b>with</b>
a relative error which is substantially independent 
<b>of</b> the number n <b>of</b> <b>events</b><br><br>
