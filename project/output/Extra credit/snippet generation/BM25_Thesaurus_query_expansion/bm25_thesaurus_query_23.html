Implementing Phrase-Structure Productions in PL/I

A method is described for implementing the productions
of a context-free phrase structure grammar 
in a PL/I procedure whose structure <b>and</b> statements parallel
the structure <b>and</b> notation of the grammar<br><br><u><b>CACM-1710.html</b></u><br> 
 ASP <b>structures</b> are built <b>and</b> manipulated by means
of a series of macro calls, which are outlined in 
the Appendix<br><br><u><b>CACM-2313.html</b></u><br>  The original concepts have split, <b>and</b> 
new terms have been adopted to name <b>and</b> refer to these
concepts<br><br><u><b>CACM-2160.html</b></u><br>  The desirable
properties claimed for this structure are 
proved, <b>and</b> file maintenance questions are discussed<br><br><u><b>CACM-2114.html</b></u><br>



A Formal System for Information Retrieval from Files

A generalized file structure is provided
by which the concepts of keyword, index, record, file, directory,
file structure, directory decoding, <b>and</b> record retrieval are defined
<b>and</b> from which some of the frequently used file <b>structures</b> such
as inverted files, index-sequential files, <b>and</b> multilist files are
derived<br><br><u><b>CACM-0527.html</b></u><br> 
 A one-to-one correspondence is established between the
recursive definition of a concept <b>and</b> its description 
list structure<br><br><u><b>CACM-2846.html</b></u><br>  This 
improvement in storage requirements <b>and</b> retrieval time
is achieved at the cost of decreasing the flexibility 
of the structure, <b>and</b> therefore updating costs are increased<br><br><u><b>CACM-2998.html</b></u><br>  These measurements reveal substantial
regularity, or predictability, among poin ters to 
atoms <b>and</b> especially among poin ters to lists<br><br><u><b>CACM-3051.html</b></u><br>
