 <b>Processors</b> <b>for</b> the two <b>languages</b> are also 
described<br><br><u><b>CACM-1530.html</b></u><br> Atlas 2 computers <b>and</b> is intended as a
tool to allow users to extend any existing programming 
language by incorporating new statements <b>and</b> other
syntactic forms of their own choosing <b>and</b> in their 
own notation<br><br><u><b>CACM-1160.html</b></u><br>  The translation processor
consists of three distinct phases: an assembly of 
the FAP program, a comprehensive analysis of the assembled
<b>code</b> with particular regard to the actions 
of instructions upon other instructions <b>and</b> upon data,
<b>and</b> finally the output pass which generates the 
COMPASS program in the form of macro instructions<br><br><u><b>CACM-1699.html</b></u><br>  Three experiments
