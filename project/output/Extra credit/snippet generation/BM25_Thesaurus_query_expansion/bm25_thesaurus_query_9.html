A System for Interprocess Communication
<b>in</b> a Resource Sharing Computer <b>Network</b>

A system of communication between processes <b>in</b> a
time-sharing system is described <b>and</b> the communication 
system is extended so that it may be used between processes
<b>distributed</b> throughout a computer <b>network</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2948.html</b></u><br>  The overall system 
design is presented along with the algorithms used to
solve three specific problems: <b>local</b> echoing, error 
detection <b>and</b> correction on the telephone lines,
<b>and</b> multiplexing of character output<br><br><u><b>CACM-1034.html</b></u><br> The analysis is geared to determining workload,
relationships <b>and</b> storage characteristics 
of documents <b>in</b> the information <b>network</b> automatically<br><br><u><b>CACM-2894.html</b></u><br>

<b>in</b> teractive system, computer service, measurement,
performance, external measurement, methodology, 
measurement model,<b>network</b> measurement system, measures, figure-of-merit<br><br><u><b>CACM-3174.html</b></u><br>  The result is a compromise between
extreme <b>security</b> <b>and</b> ease of use<br><br><u><b>CACM-1591.html</b></u><br>  Exercises 
<b>in</b> simulation <b>and</b> gaming could also be provided<br><br><u><b>CACM-2984.html</b></u><br>



Cost/Utilization: A Measure of System Performance

A method is presented for evaluating computer
system performance <b>in</b> terms of a cost/utilization 
factor <b>and</b> a measure of imbalance<br><br><u><b>CACM-2380.html</b></u><br>  Although the implementation 
described here required some compromise to achieve a
system operational within six months of hardware 
checkout, TENEX has met its major goals <b>and</b> provided
reliable service at several sites <b>and</b> through the 
ARPA <b>network</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-1749.html</b></u><br>  These sequential processes are placed
at various hierarchical levels, <b>in</b> each 
of which one or more independent abstractions have been
implemented<br><br><u><b>CACM-2955.html</b></u><br>
Comparative simulation results are also presented 
for <b>in</b> ternal, external, <b>and</b> total fragmentation<br><br>
