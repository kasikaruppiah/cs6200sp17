to produce because <b>the</b> statements <b>in</b> 
a Lucid program <b>are</b> simply axioms from which <b>the</b> proof
proceeds by (almost) conventional logical reasoning,

An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming

<b>In</b> this paper an attempt is made to explore
<b>the</b> logical foundations of computer programming 
by use of techniques which were first applied <b>in</b> <b>the</b>
study of geometry and <b>have</b> later been extended to 
other branches of mathematics<br><br><u><b>CACM-2084.html</b></u><br>

Maurer, H<br><br><u><b>CACM-1455.html</b></u><br> 
 <b>In</b> <b>the</b> TRAC language, one can write procedures for
accepting, naming and storing <b>any</b> character string 
from <b>the</b> typewriter; for modifying <b>any</b> string <b>in</b> <b>any</b> way;
for treating <b>any</b> string at <b>any</b> time as an executable 
procedure, or as a name, or as text; and for printing
out <b>any</b> string<br><br><u><b>CACM-2178.html</b></u><br>  <b>The</b> definition of Graspe here is solely <b>in</b>
terms of its semantics; <b>that</b> is, <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>structures</b> 
and operations <b>are</b> defined precisely but without assignment
of a particular syntactic representation<br><br><u><b>CACM-2937.html</b></u><br>



An Experimental Evaluation of <b>Data</b> <b>Type</b> Conventions

<b>The</b> language <b>in</b> which programs <b>are</b> written
can <b>have</b> a substantial effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reliability 
of <b>the</b> resulting programs<br><br><u><b>CACM-1860.html</b></u><br>  
<b>The</b> discussion includes a comparison <b>with</b> other work
and examples of applications of <b>the</b> language<br><br><u><b>CACM-2060.html</b></u><br>  <b>The</b> functional approach to <b>data</b> <b>structures</b> and <b>the</b>
use of references insure <b>that</b> <b>any</b> process which accepts some <b>data</b>
structure will accept <b>any</b> logically equivalent structure, regardless
of its internal representation<br><br><u><b>CACM-2739.html</b></u><br>  <b>The</b> language is used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current 
implementation of <b>the</b> Linguistic String Parser<br><br><u><b>CACM-1835.html</b></u><br> IITRAN is a procedure-oriented language
