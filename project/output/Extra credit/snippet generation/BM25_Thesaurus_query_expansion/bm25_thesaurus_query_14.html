Merge <b>Sort</b> Algorithm [M1] (Algorithm A426)

CACM May, 1972

Bron, C<br><br><u><b>CACM-0865.html</b></u><br>  The technique is shown to 
be applicable <b>for</b> the first stage <b>of</b> a generalized <b>sort</b>
program (the formation <b>of</b> initial strings) as 
well as <b>for</b> sorting records within a memory storage (an
internal <b>sort</b>)<br><br><u><b>CACM-3075.html</b></u><br>
