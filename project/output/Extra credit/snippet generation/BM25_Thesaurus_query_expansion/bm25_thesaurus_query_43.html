<b>Computer</b> Generation <b>of</b> Gamma Random Variates
with Non-integral <b>Shape</b> Parameters

When the <b>shape</b> parameter, a, is integral,
generating gamma random variables with a digital 
<b>computer</b> is straightforward<br><br><u><b>CACM-3107.html</b></u><br>  The method is compared with 
previously published methods both theoretically <b>and</b> through
<b>computer</b> timings<br><br><u><b>CACM-2883.html</b></u><br>  Some experimental results 
are given; these show how various information about the
<b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the contour <b>of</b> an object can be embedded
in the figure <b>of</b> merit, thus allowing the extraction
<b>of</b> contours from noisy picture <b>and</b> the separation 
<b>of</b> touching objects<br><br><u><b>CACM-2847.html</b></u><br>
 Experimentation <b>by</b> Robinson <b>and</b> Lewis indicates 
that for small (a) the method suggested here also dominates
methods recently suggested <b>by</b> Dieter <b>and</b> 
Ahrens, albeit those methods dominate for large (a)<br><br><u><b>CACM-2771.html</b></u><br>

<b>Computer</b> Generation <b>of</b> Gamma Random Variables

A new method for generating random variables
from the gamma distribution with nonintegral <b>shape</b> 
parameter a is proposed<br><br><u><b>CACM-3046.html</b></u><br>  The computational times for the proposed 
method remain fairly constant for medium <b>and</b> large
values <b>of</b> a <b>and</b> are superior to times obtained <b>by</b> 
Ahrens <b>and</b> Dieter's method for all values <b>of</b> a<br><br><u><b>CACM-2754.html</b></u><br>  Several parameters serve
to identify the waveform context enabling accurate 
measurement <b>of</b> peak amplitude, duration, <b>and</b> <b>shape</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2829.html</b></u><br> The <b>shape</b>
<b>and</b> size <b>of</b> this weighting function are chosen 
using digital signal processing theory<br><br><u><b>CACM-2455.html</b></u><br>  An experiment is performed to compare these
trees with standard AVL trees <b>and</b> with balanced 
trees on the basis <b>of</b> mean retrieval time, <b>of</b> amount
<b>of</b> restructuring expected, <b>and</b> on the worst case 
<b>of</b> retrieval time<br><br>
