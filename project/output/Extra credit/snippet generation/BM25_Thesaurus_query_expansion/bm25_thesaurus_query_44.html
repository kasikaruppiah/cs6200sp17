<b>by</b> comparing the region colors with the textures <b>of</b>
the corresponding regions in the picture, and also

based on topology and size<br><br><u><b>CACM-2914.html</b></u><br>



Use <b>of</b> the LRU Stack Depth Distribution
for Simulation <b>of</b> Paging Behavior

Two families <b>of</b> probability distributions were
needed for use <b>by</b> a virtual memory simulation 
model: headway between page fault distributions, and
working set size distributions<br><br><u><b>CACM-3173.html</b></u><br>



A Psychology <b>of</b> Learning BASIC

This paper addresses the question: What does a person know
following learning <b>of</b> BASIC programming?  Several underlying conceptual
structures are identified: (1) a transaction is an event that
occurs in the <b>computer</b> and involves some operation on some object
at some location, (2) a prestatement is a set <b>of</b> transactions corresponding
to a line <b>of</b> code, (3) chunks are frequently occurring
 configurations <b>of</b> prestatements corresponding to several lines <b>of</b> code<br><br><u><b>CACM-0561.html</b></u><br>

proposed as being broadly applicable to the <b>analysis</b> 
<b>of</b> in teractive <b>computer</b> systems which use nonpaged memories<br><br><u><b>CACM-2325.html</b></u><br>  These are: foundations
(finite precision number systems, computational 
complexity), <b>synthesis</b> and <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> algorithms,
