Hybrid <b>Simulation</b> Models of Computer Systems

This paper describes the structure <b>and</b> operation
of a hybrid <b>simulation</b> model <b>in</b> which both 
discrete-event <b>simulation</b> <b>and</b> analytic techniques are
combined to produce efficient yet accurate system 
models<br><br><u><b>CACM-2862.html</b></u><br>  <b>In</b> this model, program behavior
is represented by the LRU stack distance model 
<b>and</b> the PFF replacement algorithm is represented by a semi-Markov
model<br><br><u><b>CACM-2434.html</b></u><br>  Several omissions <b>in</b> his model are noted,
<b>and</b> new assumptions are introduced to overcome 
these omissions<br><br><u><b>CACM-3002.html</b></u><br>



A Record <b>and</b> File Partitioning Model

One of the main objectives <b>in</b> the design of
a file system is the reduction of storage <b>and</b> data 
transfer costs<br><br><u><b>CACM-1951.html</b></u><br>  The model used is
elementary <b>in</b> the sense that many of the random variables that
generally are of interest <b>in</b> computer communications studies can be
decomposed into the elements of this model<br><br><u><b>CACM-1503.html</b></u><br>



A SIMSCRIPT-FORTRAN Case Study

Two programs for a vehicle dispatching model,
one written <b>in</b> 7040 SIMSCRIPT <b>and</b> the other <b>in</b> 
7040 FORTRAN IV are compared<br><br><u><b>CACM-1916.html</b></u><br>  Such techniques
are used <b>and</b>, <b>in</b> addition, data references are 
represented <b>in</b> a nondirected model<br><br><u><b>CACM-1518.html</b></u><br> 
 The model is mechanized <b>in</b> SIMSCRIPT <b>and</b> consists of
some 1750 statements<br><br><u><b>CACM-2859.html</b></u><br>  The model 
of the limiting behavior of the system yields approximate
results for the simple model <b>and</b> also suggests 
that the results are valid for a much larger class of models,
including those more nearly like real systems 
that the simple model are tested against some measurements
of program behavior <b>and</b> simulations of systems 
using memory references from real programs<br><br>
