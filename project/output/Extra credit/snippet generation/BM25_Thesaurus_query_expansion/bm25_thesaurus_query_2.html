Prieve, B.
Pooch, U.</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-0321.html</b></u><br>  However, experience has shown that 
once the report is explained it is <b>in</b> fact easy to learn
ALGOL and to write algorithms <b>in</b> it<br><br><u><b>CACM-2526.html</b></u><br>  <b>In</b> particular, it is shown that it may not
be necessary to multiprogram <b>in</b> such a situation<br><br><u><b>CACM-0630.html</b></u><br>  This paper argues
that readability can be added automatically <b>in</b> 
the translation process so that the programmer can
enjoy the utmost economy of expression, while for 
management a full and valid COBOL version is printed to give
all the advantages of readability and compatibility<br><br><u><b>CACM-1282.html</b></u><br>



The Use of FORTRAN <b>in</b> Subroutines with COBOL Main Programs

<b>By</b> using the proper COBOL coding techniques and
accounting for differences <b>in</b> storage allocation 
and library routines between the two languages, it is
possible to write FORTRAN IV subroutines that may 
be called from COBOL main programs<br><br><u><b>CACM-2895.html</b></u><br>

An Interpretive Input Routine for Linear Programming

<b>In</b> this descriptive article an input code
is presented which greatly simplifies data input 
to any linear programming solution routine, for subsequent
use <b>either</b> as a pedagogical device <b>or</b> for 
solving rather small LP problems<br><br><u><b>CACM-1389.html</b></u><br>  It contains
many of the facilities which underlie such list 
processors as IPL, LISP, COMIT ad SNOBOL, but permits
the user to get much closer to machine code <b>in</b> 
order to write faster-running programs, to use storage
more efficiently and to build a wider variety 
of linked data structures<br><br><u><b>CACM-0964.html</b></u><br>
 The formulas are all rational algebraic 
expressions <b>in</b> a single variable and were constructed
<b>by</b> a recurrence procedure<br><br><u><b>CACM-0595.html</b></u><br>  How then 
might we approach solving this problem?

been eliminated <b>in</b> the list-processing facilities
