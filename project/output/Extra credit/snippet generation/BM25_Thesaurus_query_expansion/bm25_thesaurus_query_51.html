The results of simulating VMIN, Denning's working set,
<b>and</b> the page partitioning replacement <b>algorithms</b> 
on five virtual memory programs are presented to demonstrate
the improvement possible over the known 
realizable variable space <b>algorithms</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2668.html</b></u><br>  A first order Markov model of program 
behavior is assumed, <b>and</b> a representation of the system
based on memory states, control states, <b>and</b> memory 
substates is presented<br><br><u><b>CACM-2498.html</b></u><br>  Two <b>algorithms</b> 
for assigning pages to segments are discussed<br><br><u><b>CACM-1613.html</b></u><br>  The 
algorithm is a variant of the so-called "top-down"
analysis technique, <b>and</b> requires only one pass of

complex cases involving several list <b>processors</b>

 <b>Algorithms</b> for recovering discarded list structures in
