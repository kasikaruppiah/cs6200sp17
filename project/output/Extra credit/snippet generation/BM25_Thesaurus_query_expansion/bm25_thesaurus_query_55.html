Low Level Language Subroutines for Use Within Fortran

This paper describes some subroutines, coded
in symbolic <b>languages</b> and for use within Fortran 
coded programs, to deal <b>with</b> "special arithmetic" (e<br><br><u><b>CACM-1739.html</b></u><br>



<b>Regular</b> Expression Search Algorithm

A method for locating specific character strings
embedded in character text is described and 
an implementation <b>of</b> this method in the form <b>of</b> a compiler
is discussed<br><br><u><b>CACM-2184.html</b></u><br>



On the Meaning <b>of</b> Names in Programming Systems

It is assumed that there is a similarity <b>of</b>
function between the data names <b>of</b> a programming 
language and the file names <b>of</b> an operating system<br><br><u><b>CACM-1588.html</b></u><br> 
 Most list-processing <b>languages</b> have suffered from their
inability to deal directly <b>with</b> complex data 
structures and/<b>or</b> from their inability to perform the
complete range <b>of</b> programming language operations 
upon the data list structures<br><br><u><b>CACM-1455.html</b></u><br>"  Through 
the ability <b>of</b> TRAC to accept and store definitions <b>of</b>
procedures, the capabilities <b>of</b> the language can 
be indefinitely extended, and can deal <b>with</b> character
strings, integers and Boolean vector variables<br><br><u><b>CACM-0759.html</b></u><br>



Continued Operation Notation for Symbol
Manipulation and Array Processing

A brief account is given <b>of</b> a notational device
that is very useful in the formal representation 
<b>of</b> syntaxes, string relationships and string transformation
procedures and also <b>of</b> computing procedures 
that deal <b>with</b> arrays <b>of</b> functions <b>of</b> many variables<br><br><u><b>CACM-1685.html</b></u><br>  A defining description <b>of</b> a programming 
language designed for generating activity network from
a set <b>of</b> standard networks is presented<br><br><u><b>CACM-2317.html</b></u><br>



Programming Systems and <b>Languages</b> 1965-1975

In spite <b>of</b> impressive gains by PL/I, Fortran
and Cobol remain the <b>languages</b> in which most 
<b>of</b> the world's production programs are written and will
remain so into the foreseeable future<br><br><u><b>CACM-2319.html</b></u><br>  Because <b>of</b> the
severe interactions between the various subsystems 
<b>of</b> an operating system, an overall model <b>of</b> the total
system must be developed to be able to analyze 
and design the performance aspects <b>of</b> an operating system
although such total system designs are exceptional 
today, it is projected that they will become increasingly
more common and necessary in the near future<br><br><u><b>CACM-1280.html</b></u><br>
