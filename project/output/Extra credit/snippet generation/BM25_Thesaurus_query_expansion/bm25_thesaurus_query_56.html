<b>The</b> Restriction Language for Computer Grammars <b>of</b> Natural Language

Over <b>the</b> past few years, a number <b>of</b> systems
for <b>the</b> computer analysis <b>of</b> natural language 
sentences have been based on augmented context-free
grammars: a context-free grammar which defines a 
set <b>of</b> parse trees for a sentence, plus a group <b>of</b> restrictions
<b>to</b> which a tree must conform in order 
<b>to</b> be a valid sentence analysis<br><br><u><b>CACM-1487.html</b></u><br>  <b>the</b> fundamental technical 
problems with which ELIZA is concerned are: (1)<b>the</b>
identification <b>of</b> key words, (2) <b>the</b> discovery <b>of</b> 
minimal context, (3) <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> appropriate transformations,
(4) generation <b>of</b> responses in <b>the</b> absence 
<b>of</b> key words, <b>and</b> (5) <b>the</b> provision <b>of</b> an editing capability
