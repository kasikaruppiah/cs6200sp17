Implementation of <b>High</b> <b>Level</b> Language Machine

Computing machines which directly execute
the statements of a <b>high</b> <b>level</b> language have been 
proposed in the past<br><br><u><b>CACM-2906.html</b></u><br>
 In recent years, <b>very</b> <b>high</b>-<b>level</b> <b>languages</b> 
have been increasingly explored as a solution to this
problem<br><br><u><b>CACM-1923.html</b></u><br>

An Algol-Based Associative Language

A <b>high</b> <b>level</b> programming language for large,
complex associative structures has been designed 
and implemented<br><br><u><b>CACM-2246.html</b></u><br> 
 This paper discusses the relative merits of pitching
this language at a <b>high</b> <b>level</b> or a low <b>level</b>, and 
presents some comparative results<br><br><u><b>CACM-2717.html</b></u><br>

Automatic Data Structure Choice in a Language of <b>Very</b> <b>High</b> <b>Level</b>

<b>SETL</b> is a set-theoretically oriented language
of <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> whose repertoire of semantic 
objects includes finite sets, ordered n-tuples, and
sets of ordered n-tuples usable as mappings<br><br><u><b>CACM-2898.html</b></u><br>  This paper describes
a conceptual framework for a <b>high</b> <b>level</b> programming 
language providing both nonprocedural and sequential
facilities<br><br><u><b>CACM-2091.html</b></u><br>  A
convenient, easy to learn and to use, <b>high</b> <b>level</b> problem oriented
language to solve and study partial differential equation problems
has been designed; a practical translator for the language has also
been designed, and a working version of it has been constructed
for a significant portion of the language<br><br>
