A Variation on Sorting by Address Calculation

The principles of address calculation and merging are combined to yield an
efficient sorting technique<br><br><u><b>CACM-0492.html</b></u><br>  <b>For</b> the reader not interested
<b>in</b> the mathematics, the introduction and 
the summary should be sufficient<br><br><u><b>CACM-2625.html</b></u><br>



Capability-Based <b>Addressing</b>

Various <b>addressing</b> <b>schemes</b> making use of segment
tables are examined<br><br><u><b>CACM-0079.html</b></u><br>

<b>Addressing</b> Multidimensional Arrays

A useful method of representing a function of
n variables is to consider the function to assume 
its values at selected points <b>in</b> n-dimensional space<br><br><u><b>CACM-2736.html</b></u><br>

to translate simple algebraic formulas into a 
three address computer code<br><br><u><b>CACM-2253.html</b></u><br>



Index Ranges <b>for</b> Matrix Calculi

The paper describes a scheme <b>for</b> symbolic
manipulation of index expressions which arise as 
a by-product of the symbolic manipulation of expressions
<b>in</b> the matrix calculi described by the authors 
<b>in</b> a previous paper<br><br><u><b>CACM-2109.html</b></u><br>  It is shown that <b>for</b> some classes of prime numbers
the complement of the set of quadratic residues can easily be determined and 
hence the entire table of size p, where p is that prime number, can be searched<br><br><u><b>CACM-2974.html</b></u><br>
