<b>BM25</b><br><br>Query - <b>Intermediate languages used in construction of multi-targeted compilers; TCOLL</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-1681.html</b></u><br>  Requests are formulated <b>in</b> a standardized 
syntactical form (examples <b>of</b> which are presented), and
this form is then transformed into an equivalent 
query expressed <b>in</b> the retrieval system's original Symbolic
Command Language, which is briefly described<br><br><u><b>CACM-1162.html</b></u><br> 
 The meta-language presented here can be <b>used</b> to specify
the mapping <b>of</b> any language which conforms to 
a canonical list form into an arbitrary stream <b>of</b> bits<br><br><u><b>CACM-1788.html</b></u><br> 
 <b>In</b> this paper, it is contended that a programming
language is best described functionally as a body 
<b>of</b> macro instructions, and that the macro call constitutes
a canonical form <b>in</b> terms <b>of</b> which a programming 
notation may be described<br><br><u><b>CACM-1454.html</b></u><br>  The language described <b>in</b> this paper is
<b>used</b> to write computer programs which test electronic 
equipment<br><br><u><b>CACM-2652.html</b></u><br>  The results suggest a function 
which describes the effect <b>of</b> changes <b>in</b> the power <b>of</b>
a language on the compilation cost <b>of</b> an algorithm 
expressed <b>in</b> that language: when features not actually
<b>used</b> by the algorithm are removed from the language, 
the cost <b>of</b> compiling the algorithm decreases moderately,
but when features that are needed are removed, 
the compilation cost increases sharply<br><br><u><b>CACM-2739.html</b></u><br>  The language is <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the current 
implementation <b>of</b> the Linguistic String Parser<br><br><u><b>CACM-1542.html</b></u><br>  The role <b>of</b> microprogramming 
is stressed, which opens a new dimension <b>in</b> the processing
<b>of</b> interpretive code<br><br><u><b>CACM-2126.html</b></u><br>
The system and its base language are appraised with 
respect to efficiency, flexibility, and utility
for different categories <b>of</b> users<br><br><u><b>CACM-2059.html</b></u><br>



A Language for Treating Graphs

A language for the representation <b>of</b> graph is described, and the formulation <b>of</b> 
graph operations such as node and/or link deletion or insertion, union, 
intersection, comparison, and traversal <b>of</b> graphs is given<br><br><u><b>CACM-1699.html</b></u><br>  Factors involved <b>in</b> evaluation 
<b>of</b> such a system include ease <b>of</b> use, learning time, and
effectiveness <b>of</b> actual retrieval<br><br>
