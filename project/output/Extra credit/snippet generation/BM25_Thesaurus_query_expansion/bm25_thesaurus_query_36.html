A Locally-Organized Parser <b>for</b> Spoken Input

This paper describes LPARS, a locally-organized
<b>parsing</b> system, designed <b>for</b> use in a continuous 
speech recognizer<br><br><u><b>CACM-1590.html</b></u><br>

The Restriction <b>Language</b> <b>for</b> Computer Grammars of Natural <b>Language</b>

Over the past few years, a number of systems
<b>for</b> the computer analysis of natural <b>language</b> 
sentences have been based on augmented <b>context-free</b>
grammars: a <b>context-free</b> grammar which defines a 
set of parse trees <b>for</b> a sentence, plus a group of restrictions
to which a tree must conform in order 
to be a valid sentence analysis<br><br><u><b>CACM-3194.html</b></u><br>
