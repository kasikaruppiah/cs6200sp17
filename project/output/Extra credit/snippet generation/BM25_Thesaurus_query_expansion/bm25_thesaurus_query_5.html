<b>The</b> Treatment <b>of</b> Data Types in EL1

In constructing a general purpose programming
language, a key issue is providing a sufficient 
set <b>of</b> data types <b>and</b> associated operations in a manner
that permits both natural problem-oriented notation 
<b>and</b> efficient <b>implementation</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-1366.html</b></u><br>



Computer Simulation-Discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b>

<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this paper is <b>to</b> present a comparison
<b>of</b> some computer simulation languages 
<b>and</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> involved in comparing software packages
for digital computers <b>are</b> discussed in Part 
<b>I</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2311.html</b></u><br>  For each generation,

 <b>The</b> basic idea is <b>to</b> employ automatic programming techniques
so that <b>the</b> <b>interface</b> analyzes <b>and</b> efficiently

Computer Science: A Conceptual Framework for Curriculum Planning

Two <b>views</b> <b>of</b> computer science <b>are</b> considered:
a global view which attempts <b>to</b> capture broad 
characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field <b>and</b> its relationships <b>to</b>
other fields, <b>and</b> a local view which focuses <b>on</b> 
<b>the</b> inner structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field<br><br>
