Merging with <b>Parallel</b> Processors

Consider two linearly ordered sets A, B, |A|=m,
|B|=n, m<=n, <b>and</b> p, p<=m, <b>parallel</b> processors 
working synchronously<br><br><u><b>CACM-0950.html</b></u><br>



<b>Parallel</b> Methods <b>for</b> Integrating Ordinary Differential Equations

This paper is dedicated to the proposition that,
in order to take full advantage <b>for</b> real-time 
computations of highly <b>parallel</b> computers as can be
expected to be available in the near future, much 
of numerical analysis will have to be recast in a more
"<b>parallel</b>" form<br><br><u><b>CACM-1262.html</b></u><br>  These serve partly as brackets in establishing
a range of <b>parallel</b> operation <b>and</b> partly to 
define each <b>parallel</b> path within this range<br><br><u><b>CACM-3075.html</b></u><br>



Fast <b>Parallel</b> Sorting <b>Algorithms</b>

A <b>parallel</b> bucket-sort algorithm is presented
that requires time O(log n) <b>and</b> the use of n 
processors<br><br><u><b>CACM-1601.html</b></u><br>



<b>Parallel</b> Numerical Methods <b>for</b> the Solution of Equations

Classical iterative procedures <b>for</b> the numerical
solution of equations provide at each stage 
a single new approximation to the root in question<br><br><u><b>CACM-2266.html</b></u><br>  The algorithm, which
is conceptually suitable <b>for</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>computation</b>, 
determines its own starting values so that convergence
to the zeros is guaranteed<br><br><u><b>CACM-2700.html</b></u><br>



Reduction: A Method of Proving Properties of <b>Parallel</b> Programs

When proving that a <b>parallel</b> program has a
given property it is often convenient to assume 
that a statement is indivisible, i<br><br><u><b>CACM-2685.html</b></u><br>
