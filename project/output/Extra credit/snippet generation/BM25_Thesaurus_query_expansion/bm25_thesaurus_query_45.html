A Marovian Model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Michigan Executive <b>System</b>

A mathematical model <b>of</b> a computer's executive
<b>system</b> is postulated <b>and</b> its parameters estimated 
with <b>the</b> aid <b>of</b> extensive data on <b>the</b> <b>system</b>'s operation<br><br><u><b>CACM-2862.html</b></u><br>  <b>This</b> significantly reduces

A Record <b>and</b> <b>File</b> Partitioning Model

One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main objectives in <b>the</b> design <b>of</b>
a <b>file</b> <b>system</b> is <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> storage <b>and</b> data 
transfer costs<br><br><u><b>CACM-1951.html</b></u><br>  Data were examined
from four operational multiaccess systems, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> model is shown <b>to</b>
be robust; that is each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variables <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model has <b>the</b>
same distribution independent <b>of</b> which <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four systems is being examined<br><br><u><b>CACM-1503.html</b></u><br> 
 In <b>the</b> FORTRAN program, basic design problems relate
<b>to</b> <b>the</b> representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passage <b>of</b> time, <b>the</b> 
allocation <b>of</b> storage, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> organization <b>of</b> input
data<br><br><u><b>CACM-1916.html</b></u><br>  Analysis <b>of</b> these <b>models</b>
prior <b>to</b> execution yields <b>information</b> valuable 
in determining segmentation <b>of</b> instructions <b>and</b> data for
a time-shared environment, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> for initial 
page loading; during execution, <b>the</b> analysis may be
used for "look ahead" control <b>of</b> page turning<br><br><u><b>CACM-3070.html</b></u><br>  <b>The</b> accuracy <b>and</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b>

model<br><br><u><b>CACM-2977.html</b></u><br>  <b>The</b> analysis suggests an alternative model

<b>of</b> <b>the</b> limiting behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> yields approximate
results for <b>the</b> simple model <b>and</b> also suggests 
that <b>the</b> results are valid for a much larger class <b>of</b> <b>models</b>,
