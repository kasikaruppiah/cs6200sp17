Automatic Analysis of Electronic Digital <b>Circuits</b> Using List Processing

A mapping from black diagrams of digital <b>circuits</b>
to list structures is described, together 
with a list processing program written <b>for</b> the Control
Data 3600 which uses this mapping to automatically 
carry out circuit analysis<br><br><u><b>CACM-2469.html</b></u><br>
