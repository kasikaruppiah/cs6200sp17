Threaded <b>Code</b>

The concept <b>of</b> "threaded <b>code</b>" is presented as
an alternative to <b>machine</b> language <b>code</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2748.html</b></u><br>  It is related to Bell's notion 
<b>of</b> threaded <b>code</b> but requires less space <b>and</b> is more
amenable to <b>machine</b> independent implementations<br><br><u><b>CACM-2897.html</b></u><br> 
 Such a compiler translates the parsed source <b>code</b> into
lower level <b>code</b> by a sequence <b>of</b> steps<br><br><u><b>CACM-1362.html</b></u><br>



<b>Code</b> Extension in ASCII* (An ASA Tutorial)

The American Standard <b>Code</b> for Information
Interchange (ASCII) contains a number <b>of</b> control 
characters associated with the principle <b>of</b> <b>code</b> extension,
that is, with the representation <b>of</b> information 
which cannot be directly represented by means <b>of</b> the characters
in the <b>Code</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-0048.html</b></u><br>
 A high degree <b>of</b> redundancy is used, permitting 
a single-error correcting <b>code</b> ("minimum-distance-three"
<b>code</b>) with 64 10-bit <b>code</b> words to be employed 
as the station identification <b>code</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-1223.html</b></u><br>
 <b>Optimization</b> such as the effective use <b>of</b> index 
registers, although as important, is not discussed since
the object <b>code</b> which would be most efficient 
is highly <b>machine</b> dependent<br><br><u><b>CACM-1947.html</b></u><br>

Methods <b>of</b> analyzing the control flow <b>and</b> data
flow <b>of</b> programs during compilation are applied

Implications <b>of</b> Structured Programming for <b>Machine</b> Architecture

Based on an empirical study <b>of</b> more than 10,000
lines <b>of</b> program text written in a GOTO-less 
language, a <b>machine</b> architecture specifically designed for
structured programs is proposed<br><br>
