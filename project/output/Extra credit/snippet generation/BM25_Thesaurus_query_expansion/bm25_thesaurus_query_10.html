of the research is that an information retrieval system

Glypnir-A Programming Language <b>for</b> Illiac IV

GLYPNIR is one of the earliest existing <b>languages</b>
designed <b>for</b> programming the Illiac IV computer<br><br><u><b>CACM-2895.html</b></u><br>



A Language <b>for</b> Formal Problem Specification

A language <b>for</b> specifying the in tended behavior
of communicating <b>parallel</b> processes is described<br><br><u><b>CACM-1262.html</b></u><br>  These serve partly as brackets in establishing
a range of <b>parallel</b> operation and partly to 
define each <b>parallel</b> path within this range<br><br><u><b>CACM-2519.html</b></u><br>



On the Problem of Communicating Complex Information

The nature of the difficulty involved in communicating
mathematical results between scientists 
using a computer based information retrieval system
is examined<br><br><u><b>CACM-1467.html</b></u><br>



A Graphical ServiceSystem With Variable Syntax

Man-machine interaction in many fields of endeavor
should be greatly facilitated in the near 
future through the use of interactive graphical <b>languages</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2898.html</b></u><br>  This paper describes
a conceptual framework <b>for</b> a high level programming 
language providing both nonprocedural and sequential
facilities<br><br><u><b>CACM-1471.html</b></u><br>



Programming Semantics <b>for</b> Multiprogrammed computations

The semantics are defined <b>for</b> a number of meta-instructions
which perform operation essential 
to the writing of programs in multiprogrammed computer
systems<br><br><u><b>CACM-1162.html</b></u><br>  Assembly
<b>languages</b> generally provide a one-<b>for</b>-one translation 
from a symbolic to a numeric version of a program, that
is, from assembly language to machine language<br><br>
