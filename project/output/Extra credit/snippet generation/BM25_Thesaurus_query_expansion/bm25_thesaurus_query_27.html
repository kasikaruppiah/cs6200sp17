Implementation <b>of</b> the SHARER2 Time-Sharing System

A simple mechanism is described for the execution
<b>of</b> part <b>of</b> a program with its own <b>memory</b> 
protection<br><br><u><b>CACM-2319.html</b></u><br>  Because <b>of</b> the
severe interactions between the various subsystems 
<b>of</b> an <b>operating</b> system, an overall model <b>of</b> the total
system must be developed to be able to analyze 
and design the performance <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> an <b>operating</b> system
although such total system designs are exceptional 
today, it is projected that they will become increasingly
more common and necessary in the near future<br><br><u><b>CACM-2681.html</b></u><br>



Dynamic <b>Memory</b> Repacking

A probabilistic model <b>of</b> a multiprogramming system
is exercised in order to determine the conditions 
under which the dynamic repacking <b>of</b> main <b>memory</b> is beneficial<br><br><u><b>CACM-2435.html</b></u><br>



A Class <b>of</b> Dynamic <b>Memory</b> Allocation Algorithms

Anew dynamic <b>memory</b> allocation algorithm, the
Fibonacci system, is introduced<br><br><u><b>CACM-1482.html</b></u><br>
 The main concept <b>of</b> the system is the use <b>of</b> 
a collection <b>of</b> programmable pointers, which
are visualized as a family <b>of</b> "bugs<br><br><u><b>CACM-2560.html</b></u><br>



A Queuing Model <b>of</b> a Multiprogrammed
Computer with a Two-Level Storage System

The results are presented <b>of</b> an analysis <b>of</b>
a probabilistic model <b>of</b> a multiprogrammed computer 
system with a two-level storage system in which there
is sequential dependency <b>of</b> accesses between the 
devices<br><br><u><b>CACM-1885.html</b></u><br>  The system deals with the transformational
model <b>of</b> syntax, along the lines <b>of</b> 
Chomsky's <b>Aspects</b> <b>of</b> the Theory <b>of</b> Syntax<br><br><u><b>CACM-1591.html</b></u><br>  In 
addition, the advantages <b>of</b> this type <b>of</b> system for computer
programming and operation are also considered<br><br><u><b>CACM-2955.html</b></u><br>



Buddy <b>Systems</b>

Two algorithms are presented for implementing
any <b>of</b> a class <b>of</b> buddy <b>systems</b> for dynamic storage 
allocation<br><br><u><b>CACM-1523.html</b></u><br>  Implementation
time was approximately six man-years, with the 
majority <b>of</b> the code being written in FORTRAN<br><br>
