A Methodology for Calculating and
Optimizing Real-Time System Performance

<b>The</b> continually increasing size, complexity,
number <b>of</b> types, and cost <b>of</b> data processing <b>systems</b> 
are causing serious re-examination within government
and industry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> criteria for and methods <b>of</b> 
calculating and optimizing data processing system cost
and performance<br><br><u><b>CACM-2371.html</b></u><br>
