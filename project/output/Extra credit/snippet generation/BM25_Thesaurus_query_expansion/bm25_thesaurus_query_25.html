A Marovian Model <b>of</b> the University <b>of</b> Michigan Executive System

A mathematical model <b>of</b> a <b>computer</b>'s executive
system is postulated <b>and</b> its parameters estimated 
with the aid <b>of</b> extensive data on the system's operation<br><br><u><b>CACM-1518.html</b></u><br>



An Experimental Model <b>of</b> System/360

The problem <b>of</b> predicting the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b>
modern <b>computer</b> <b>systems</b> is formidable<br><br><u><b>CACM-2188.html</b></u><br>  The parameters <b>of</b> the model are functions
<b>of</b> the capabilities <b>of</b> the graphics hardware 
<b>and</b> <b>of</b> the computational requirements <b>of</b> the graphics application<br><br><u><b>CACM-2560.html</b></u><br>



A Queuing Model <b>of</b> a Multiprogrammed
<b>Computer</b> with a Two-Level Storage System

The results are presented <b>of</b> an analysis <b>of</b>
a probabilistic model <b>of</b> a multiprogrammed <b>computer</b> 
system with a two-level storage system in which there
is sequential dependency <b>of</b> accesses between the 
devices<br><br><u><b>CACM-1591.html</b></u><br>  In 
addition, the advantages <b>of</b> this type <b>of</b> system for <b>computer</b>
programming <b>and</b> operation are also considered<br><br><u><b>CACM-3002.html</b></u><br>



A Record <b>and</b> File Partitioning Model

One <b>of</b> the main objectives in the design <b>of</b>
a file system is the reduction <b>of</b> storage <b>and</b> data 
transfer costs<br><br><u><b>CACM-2681.html</b></u><br>
 An expression is derived for the maximum 
interference that a repacking process may introduce
before the original <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> the system is 
degraded<br><br><u><b>CACM-3070.html</b></u><br>  The accuracy <b>and</b> efficiency <b>of</b> the
hybrid technique are demonstrated by comparing 
the result <b>and</b> computational costs <b>of</b> the hybrid model <b>of</b>
the example with those <b>of</b> an equivalent simulation-only 
model<br><br><u><b>CACM-3048.html</b></u><br>



<b>Performance</b> <b>Evaluation</b> <b>of</b> Highly Concurrent
Computers by Deterministic Simulation

Simulation is presented as a practical technique
for <b>performance</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> alternative 
configurations <b>of</b> highly concurrent computers<br><br><u><b>CACM-2859.html</b></u><br>  The model 
<b>of</b> the limiting behavior <b>of</b> the system yields approximate
results for the simple model <b>and</b> also suggests 
that the results are valid for a much larger class <b>of</b> models,
including those more nearly like real <b>systems</b> 
that the simple model are tested against some measurements
<b>of</b> program behavior <b>and</b> simulations <b>of</b> <b>systems</b> 
using memory references from real programs<br><br>
