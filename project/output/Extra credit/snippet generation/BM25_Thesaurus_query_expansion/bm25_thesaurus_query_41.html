The Effects <b>of</b> Multiplexing on a Computer-Communications System

A study is made <b>of</b> the way <b>in</b> which <b>asynchronous</b>
time division multiplexing changes the stochastic 
nature <b>of</b> the arrival process from a user to the computer
<b>and</b>, consequently, affects the performance 
<b>of</b> a time-shared computer-communications system<br><br><u><b>CACM-2681.html</b></u><br>



Dynamic Memory Repacking

A probabilistic model <b>of</b> a multiprogramming system
is exercised <b>in</b> order to determine the conditions 
under which the dynamic repacking <b>of</b> main memory is beneficial<br><br><u><b>CACM-1533.html</b></u><br>  The model is used to study 
the effects <b>of</b> changes <b>in</b> the executive system <b>and</b>
<b>in</b> one <b>of</b> its compilers<br><br><u><b>CACM-2452.html</b></u><br>



Evaluation <b>and</b> Selection <b>of</b> File Organization-A Model <b>and</b> System

This work first discusses the factors that
affect file (data base) organization performance, 
an elusive subject, <b>and</b> then presents a methodology, a
model <b>and</b> a programmed system to estimate primarily 
total storage costs <b>and</b> average access time <b>of</b> several
file organizations, given a specific data base, 
query characterization <b>and</b> device-related specifications<br><br><u><b>CACM-2188.html</b></u><br>  The parameters <b>of</b> the model are functions
<b>of</b> the capabilities <b>of</b> the graphics hardware 
<b>and</b> <b>of</b> the computational requirements <b>of</b> the graphics application<br><br><u><b>CACM-1698.html</b></u><br>  Using the model we answer questions like: 
How many <b>processes</b> are suspended waiting <b>for</b> console 
input?  What is the maximum rate at which a process can
execute?  What <b>bounds</b> can be set on overall buffer 
requirements?  Answers to these <b>and</b> similar questions
are needed <b>in</b> certain aspects <b>of</b> operating system 
design<br><br><u><b>CACM-1518.html</b></u><br>



An Experimental Model <b>of</b> System/360

The problem <b>of</b> predicting the performance <b>of</b>
modern computer <b>systems</b> is formidable<br><br><u><b>CACM-3002.html</b></u><br>



A Record <b>and</b> File Partitioning Model

One <b>of</b> the main objectives <b>in</b> the design <b>of</b>
a file system is the reduction <b>of</b> storage <b>and</b> data 
transfer costs<br><br><u><b>CACM-2560.html</b></u><br>



A Queuing Model <b>of</b> a Multiprogrammed
Computer with a Two-Level Storage System

The results are presented <b>of</b> an analysis <b>of</b>
a probabilistic model <b>of</b> a multiprogrammed computer 
system with a two-level storage system <b>in</b> which there
is sequential dependency <b>of</b> accesses between the 
devices<br><br><u><b>CACM-1591.html</b></u><br>  <b>In</b> 
addition, the advantages <b>of</b> this type <b>of</b> system <b>for</b> computer
programming <b>and</b> operation are <b>also</b> considered<br><br>
