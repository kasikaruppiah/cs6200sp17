is defined<br><br><u><b>CACM-2309.html</b></u><br>



Computers in the Instructional Process:
Directions for Research and Development

A survey is given of computer applications
to the instructional process which suggests how 
the computer professional can contribute to effective educational systems<br><br><u><b>CACM-2912.html</b></u><br>
 These solutions do not assume any synchronizing 
mechanism other than data which can be written
by one process and read by other <b>processes</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2219.html</b></u><br>



A Policy-Driven Scheduler for a Time-Sharing System

The service received by a process from a time-sharing
operating system can be characterized 
by a resource count SUM{w[i]R[ij]} where R[ij] is the
number of units of service received by process 
i from resource i and w[i] is the cost per unit of the
service<br><br><u><b>CACM-0198.html</b></u><br>

The Effects of Multiplexing on a Computer-Communications System

A study is made of the way in which asynchronous
time division multiplexing changes the <b>stochastic</b> 
nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer
and, consequently, affects the performance 
of a time-shared computer-communications system<br><br>
