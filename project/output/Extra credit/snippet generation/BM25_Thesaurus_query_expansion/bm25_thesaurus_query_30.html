The Structure of the "THE"-Multiprogramming System

A multiprogramming system <b>is</b> described in
which all activities are divided over a number of 
sequential processes<br><br><u><b>CACM-2955.html</b></u><br>
Norman, <b>T</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-1657.html</b></u><br>  An improved version of the 
SHARER time-sharing system using this feature <b>is</b> described<br><br><u><b>CACM-2371.html</b></u><br>



A System for Interprocess Communication
in a Resource Sharing Computer Network

A system of communication between processes in a
time-sharing system <b>is</b> described and the communication 
system <b>is</b> extended so that it may be used between processes
distributed throughout a computer network<br><br><u><b>CACM-2560.html</b></u><br>



A Queuing Model of a Multiprogrammed
Computer with a Two-Level Storage System

The results are presented of an analysis of
a probabilistic model of a multiprogrammed computer 
system with a two-level storage system in which there
<b>is</b> sequential dependency of accesses between the 
devices<br><br><u><b>CACM-2379.html</b></u><br>
 In this paper the development of the system <b>is</b> 
described, with particular emphasis <b>on</b> the principles which guided the design<br><br><u><b>CACM-2948.html</b></u><br>  The overall system 
design <b>is</b> presented along with the algorithms used to
solve three specific problems: local echoing, error 
detection and correction <b>on</b> the telephone lines,
and multiplexing of character output<br><br><u><b>CACM-1719.html</b></u><br>  Criteria for evaluating 
performance are described; a methodology for calculating
and optimizing <b>is</b> outlined; and the method <b>is</b> 
illustrated by carrying out a portion of the performance
calculation and the optimization of a drum-oriented 
message switching system<br><br>
