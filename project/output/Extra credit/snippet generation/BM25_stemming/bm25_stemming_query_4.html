Machine Calculation of Moments of a Probability Distribution

A method is presented for the calculation on a
machine of the moments of a probability distribution, 
necessitating little more than n additions <b>and</b> n references
to memory for each moment, instead of the 
minimum of n multiplication, 2n additions, <b>and</b> 2n references
to memory required by the most straightforward 
method (where n is the number of entries in the probability
distribution)<br><br><u><b>CACM-2949.html</b></u><br>  The Topology

Use of the LRU Stack Depth Distribution
for Simulation of Paging Behavior

Two families of probability distributions were
needed for use by a virtual memory simulation 
model: headway between page fault distributions, <b>and</b>
working set size distributions<br><br>
