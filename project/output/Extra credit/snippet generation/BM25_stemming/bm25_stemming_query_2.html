Optimal <b>Space</b> Allocation on Disk Storage Devices

When the amount of <b>space</b> required <b>for</b> file storage
exceeds the amount which can be kept on-line, 
decisions must be made as to which files are to be permanently

several criteria <b>for</b> best allocating storage <b>space</b> to the files<br><br><u><b>CACM-3033.html</b></u><br>  The former
technique is quite effective, but its time and
