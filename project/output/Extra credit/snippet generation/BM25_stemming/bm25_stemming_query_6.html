examines the interrelationships between models <b>and</b> other
methods for evaluating the performance <b>of</b> computer 
systems <b>and</b> establishes circumstances under
which the use <b>of</b> a <b>model</b> is appropriate<br><br><u><b>CACM-3048.html</b></u><br>  Simulation <b>of</b> the

statistics needed for performance evaluation, without
the necessity <b>of</b> emulating the <b>system</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-3070.html</b></u><br>  The accuracy <b>and</b> efficiency <b>of</b> the
hybrid technique are demonstrated by comparing 
the result <b>and</b> computational costs <b>of</b> the hybrid <b>model</b> <b>of</b>
the example with those <b>of</b> an equivalent simulation-only

The Effects <b>of</b> Multiplexing on a Computer-Communications <b>System</b>

A study is made <b>of</b> the way in which asynchronous
time division multiplexing changes the stochastic 
nature <b>of</b> the arrival process from a user to the computer
<b>and</b>, consequently, affects the performance 
<b>of</b> a time-shared computer-communications <b>system</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-1680.html</b></u><br>  It expands the power
<b>and</b> flexibility <b>of</b> computer-assisted instruction 
by making immediately available to students, teachers,
<b>and</b> other users, the full resources (<b>system</b>-cataloged 
programs) <b>of</b> the operating <b>system</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2988.html</b></u><br>

This paper presents a computationally tractable
methodology for including accurately the effects

with this <b>model</b>, the results <b>of</b> the experiments,
<b>and</b> the application <b>of</b> the results are discussed<br><br><u><b>CACM-3136.html</b></u><br> computer market have been developed to study 
the relationships between <b>system</b> price <b>and</b> hardware performance<br><br><u><b>CACM-2522.html</b></u><br>  This report discusses the design <b>and</b>
