Parallelism in Tape-Sorting

Two methods for employing parallelism in tape-sorting
are presented<br><br><u><b>CACM-1262.html</b></u><br>  These serve partly as brackets in establishing
a range of <b>parallel</b> operation and partly to 
define each <b>parallel</b> path within this range<br><br><u><b>CACM-1811.html</b></u><br>



A Case Study in Programming for <b>Parallel</b>-Processors

An affirmative partial answer is provided to
the question of whether it is possible to program 
<b>parallel</b>-processor computing systems to efficiently decrease
execution time for useful problems<br><br><u><b>CACM-2700.html</b></u><br>



Reduction: A Method of Proving Properties of <b>Parallel</b> Programs

When proving that a <b>parallel</b> program has a
given property it is often convenient to assume 
that a statement is indivisible, i<br><br><u><b>CACM-2685.html</b></u><br>



The <b>Parallel</b> Execution of DO Loops

Methods are developed for the <b>parallel</b> execution
of different iterations of a DO loop<br><br><u><b>CACM-1158.html</b></u><br>



Program Structures for <b>Parallel</b> Processing

Constructs for organizing and explicating <b>parallel</b>
program segments are discussed as extensions 
to ALGOL 60<br><br><u><b>CACM-2714.html</b></u><br>  These performances compare very favorably with
the previous best <b>parallel</b> merging <b>algorithm</b>, 
Batcher's <b>algorithm</b>, which requires n/p + ((m+n)/2p)log2 m
steps in the general case and km/p + ((k+1)/2)(m/p)log2 
m in the special case where n=km<br><br><u><b>CACM-2785.html</b></u><br>

<b>Parallel</b> Methods for Integrating Ordinary Differential Equations

This paper is dedicated to the proposition that,
in order to take full advantage for real-time 
computations of highly <b>parallel</b> computers as can be
expected to be available in the near future, much 
of numerical analysis will have to be recast in a more
"<b>parallel</b>" form<br><br>
