Procedure-Oriented Language Statements to Facilitate <b>Parallel</b> Processing

Two statements are suggested which allow a programmer
writing <b>in</b> a procedure-oriented language 
to indicate sections of program which are to be executed

<b>Parallel</b> Methods for Integrating Ordinary Differential Equations

This paper is dedicated to the proposition that,
<b>in</b> order to take full advantage for real-time 
computations of highly <b>parallel</b> computers as can be
expected to be available <b>in</b> the near future, much 
of numerical analysis will have to be recast <b>in</b> a more
"<b>parallel</b>" form<br><br><u><b>CACM-2664.html</b></u><br>

the previous best <b>parallel</b> merging algorithm, 
Batcher's algorithm, which requires n/p + ((m+n)/2p)log2 m

Models for <b>Parallel</b> Processing WIthin Programs:
Application to CPU:I/O and I/O:I/O Overlap

Approximate queueing models for internal <b>parallel</b>
processing by individual programs <b>in</b> a multiprogrammed 
system are developed <b>in</b> this paper<br><br><u><b>CACM-1601.html</b></u><br>  The s8everal
