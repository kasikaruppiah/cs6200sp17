Stochastic Evaluation of a Static Storage Allocation

CACM October, 1961

Cohen, L<br><br><u><b>CACM-1410.html</b></u><br>  The input <b>process</b> 
is assumed to be stationary, and to be defined by the
interarrival time distribution<br><br><u><b>CACM-2535.html</b></u><br> 
 Analytical results include a general description of the
output <b>process</b> of an M/D/1 queue and the conditions 
under which this output <b>process</b> is approximately Poisson<br><br><u><b>CACM-1194.html</b></u><br>

Conventions for the Use of Symbols in the Preparation
of Flowcharts for Information Processing 
Systems (A Standard Working Paper)

This paper is intended as an outline of the
various conventions which are being considered 
for the use of flowcharts for information processing
systems<br><br><u><b>CACM-3020.html</b></u><br>  First, 
the paper describes the recursion-removal <b>process</b> and the
example on which it will be illustrated<br><br><u><b>CACM-0020.html</b></u><br>



Accelerating Convergence of Iterative Processes

A technique is discussed which, when applied
to an iterative procedure for the solution of
an equation, accelerates the rate of convergence if
the iteration converges and induces convergence if
the iteration diverges<br><br><u><b>CACM-2065.html</b></u><br>
