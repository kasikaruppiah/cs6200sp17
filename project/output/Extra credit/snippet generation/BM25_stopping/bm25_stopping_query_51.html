Fast <b>Parallel</b> Sorting <b>Algorithms</b>

A <b>parallel</b> bucket-sort algorithm is presented
that requires time O(log n) <b>and</b> the use of n 
<b>processors</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-3156.html</b></u><br>



Computing Connected Components on <b>Parallel</b> Computers

We present a <b>parallel</b> algorithm which uses n2 <b>processors</b> to find the connected
components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time O(log2n)<br><br><u><b>CACM-2714.html</b></u><br>



Merging with <b>Parallel</b> <b>Processors</b>

Consider two linearly ordered sets A, B, |A|=m,
|B|=n, m<=n, <b>and</b> p, p<=m, <b>parallel</b> <b>processors</b> 
working synchronously<br><br><u><b>CACM-3006.html</b></u><br> 
 Two <b>paging</b> <b>algorithms</b>, are examined in terms of their
anomaly potential, <b>and</b> reference string examples 
of various anomalies are presented<br><br><u><b>CACM-2570.html</b></u><br>  It is shown that 
different <b>algorithms</b> suggested in the literature vary significantly
in execution time <b>and</b> that the B-schedule 
of Coffman <b>and</b> Graham is near-optimal<br><br><u><b>CACM-2723.html</b></u><br>  The more
complex cases involving several list <b>processors</b> 
<b>and</b> one or more garbage collection <b>processors</b> are also briefly discussed<br><br><u><b>CACM-2973.html</b></u><br>

<b>parallel</b> computer, <b>parallel</b> sorting, <b>parallel</b> merge,
routing <b>and</b> comparison steps, perfect shuffle<br><br><u><b>CACM-1811.html</b></u><br>  Communication
between cooperating <b>processors</b> is by 
means of data in storage shared by all <b>processors</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2497.html</b></u><br>



Synchronizing <b>Processors</b> with Memory-Content-Generated Interrupts

Implementations of the "Lock-Unlock" method
of synchronizing <b>processors</b> in a multiprocessor 
system usually require uninterruptable, memory-pause type instructions<br><br><u><b>CACM-1752.html</b></u><br>  A synopsis is given 
of the task scheduling <b>and</b> <b>paging</b> <b>algorithms</b> that were implemented,
<b>and</b> the results of comparative simulation 
are given by tracing the development of the <b>algorithms</b>
through six predecessor versions<br><br>
