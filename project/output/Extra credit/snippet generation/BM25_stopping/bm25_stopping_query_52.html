The Digital <b>Simulation</b> of River Plankton Population Dynamics

This paper deals with the development of a
mathematical model for <b>and</b> the digital <b>simulation</b> 
<b>in</b> Fortran IV of phytoplankton <b>and</b> zooplankton population
densities <b>in</b> a river using previously developed 
rate expressions<br><br><u><b>CACM-2749.html</b></u><br>

A Comparison of <b>Simulation</b> Event List Algorithms

Four algorithms are considered which can be used
to schedule events <b>in</b> a general purpose discrete 
<b>simulation</b> system<br><br><u><b>CACM-1928.html</b></u><br>  The main results obtained 
are a clear <b>and</b> useful separation of structural <b>and</b> behavioral
model description, a reduction of manual 
tasks <b>in</b> converting Boolean logic into a structural model,
the elimination of manual processes <b>in</b> achieving 
exclusive <b>simulation</b> of activity, an event-scheduling
technique which does not deteriorate <b>in</b> economy
as the event queue grows <b>in</b> length, <b>and</b> a <b>simulation</b>
procedure which deals effectively with any mixture 
of serial <b>and</b> simultaneous activities<br><br><u><b>CACM-1366.html</b></u><br> 
 The conclusion of the paper is that the packages now
available for computer <b>simulation</b> offer features 
which none of the more general-purpose packages do <b>and</b>
that analysis of strengths <b>and</b> weaknesses of each 
suggests ways <b>in</b> which both current <b>and</b> future <b>simulation</b>
languages <b>and</b> packages can be improved<br><br><u><b>CACM-3070.html</b></u><br>



Hybrid <b>Simulation</b> Models of Computer Systems

This paper describes the structure <b>and</b> operation
of a hybrid <b>simulation</b> model <b>in</b> which both 
discrete-event <b>simulation</b> <b>and</b> analytic techniques are
combined to produce efficient yet accurate system

Some Techniques for Using Pseudorandom Numbers <b>in</b> Computer <b>Simulation</b>

An algorithm is described by which uniform pseudorandom
integers may be used to construct binary 
"numbers" <b>in</b> which the probability that each bit <b>in</b> the
word is a 1-bit <b>and</b> can assume any desired parameter 
value<br><br><u><b>CACM-3051.html</b></u><br>
