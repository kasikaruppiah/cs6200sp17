Capability-Based <b>Addressing</b>

Various <b>addressing</b> <b>schemes</b> making use of segment
tables are examined<br><br><u><b>CACM-1869.html</b></u><br>  However, when indirect
<b>addressing</b> is used, as <b>in</b> SNOBOL, naming constraints 
may be introduced<br><br><u><b>CACM-2194.html</b></u><br> <b>For</b> example,
some computers permit either 8-bit <b>addressing</b> 
(interpreted relative to the location counter) or full
16-bit <b>addressing</b> of all of memory<br><br><u><b>CACM-1785.html</b></u><br>



Scatter Storage Techniques

Scatter storage techniques as a method <b>for</b>
implementing the symbol tables of assemblers and 
compilers are reviewed and a number of ways of using
them more effectively are presented<br><br><u><b>CACM-2541.html</b></u><br>  It also suggested an important
new concept <b>for</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b>: separation 
of the scheduling from the maintenance functions <b>in</b> <b>resource</b>
allocation<br><br><u><b>CACM-2858.html</b></u><br>



A Process <b>for</b> the Determination of
Addresses <b>in</b> Variable Length <b>Addressing</b>

An algorithm is presented <b>for</b> the assignment
of instruction addresses and formats under the 
following conditions: (1) the length of the instruction varies
as a function of the distance of the instruction 
from its target; (2) there exists an optimality criterion
which implies some preferential choices subject 
to the <b>addressing</b> constraints<br><br><u><b>CACM-2830.html</b></u><br>
