System <b>Performance</b> <b>Evaluation</b>: Survey <b>and</b> Appraisal

The state of the art of system <b>performance</b>
<b>evaluation</b> is reviewed <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> goals <b>and</b> 
problems are examined<br><br><u><b>CACM-2984.html</b></u><br>



Cost/Utilization: A Measure of System <b>Performance</b>

A method is presented for evaluating <b>computer</b>
system <b>performance</b> in terms of a cost/utilization 
factor <b>and</b> a measure of imbalance<br><br><u><b>CACM-2319.html</b></u><br>



Operating System <b>Performance</b>

An overview of the current <b>and</b> future positions
with respect to operating system <b>performance</b> 
is given<br><br><u><b>CACM-1938.html</b></u><br>  Six criteria are described 
which have been successfully used to perform first-level
quantitative time-sharing system <b>performance</b> 
<b>evaluation</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2894.html</b></u><br>  Its primary 
purpose is to enable external, user-oriented assessment
of <b>computer</b> <b>performance</b>, instead of the more 
frequently used in ternal system measurement <b>techniques</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2542.html</b></u><br>  A system which integrates <b>performance</b> <b>evaluation</b>
with design <b>and</b> implementation is described<br><br><u><b>CACM-3048.html</b></u><br>
