A Note on Information Organization and Storage

Since the logical structure of a data base
can be represented by a tree or <b>graph</b>, it is quite 
natural for us <b>to</b> view the process of designing a data
base as that of constructing a tree or a <b>graph</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2177.html</b></u><br>  For both representations
the time required <b>to</b> analyze a <b>graph</b> 
on n nodes increases as n^G where G depends on the type
of <b>graph</b>, 1 <= G <= 2, and both bounds are attained<br><br>
