Interarrival Statistics for Time Sharing Systems

The optimization of time-shared system performance
requires the description of the <b>stochastic</b> 
<b>processes</b> governing the user inputs and the program activity<br><br><u><b>CACM-1540.html</b></u><br>  The algorithm
is more <b>stochastic</b> than Monte Carlo in nature<br><br><u><b>CACM-2882.html</b></u><br>



A <b>Stochastic</b> Evaluation Model for Database
Organization in Data Retrieval Systems

Experimental work in the valuation of large
scale data retrieval systems has been scarce due 
to its difficulty and prohibitive cost<br><br><u><b>CACM-1435.html</b></u><br> 
 The four experimental design problems are: (1) the
problem of <b>stochastic</b> convergence, (2) the problem 
of factor selection, (3) the problem of motive
and (4) the many response problem<br><br><u><b>CACM-1194.html</b></u><br>



Establishment of the ACM Repository and Principles
of the IR System <b>Applied</b> to its Operation

The history of the establishment of the ACM Repository
at the Moore School, University of Pennsylvania, 
is reviewed briefly<br><br><u><b>CACM-2742.html</b></u><br>  This
problem may be attributed in part to difficulties 
such as slow <b>stochastic</b> convergence<br><br><u><b>CACM-1235.html</b></u><br>

The Effects of Multiplexing on a Computer-Communications System

A study is made of the way in which asynchronous
time division multiplexing changes the <b>stochastic</b> 
nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer
and, consequently, affects the performance 
of a time-shared computer-communications system<br><br>
