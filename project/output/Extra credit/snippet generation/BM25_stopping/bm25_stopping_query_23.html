A Position Paper on <b>Computing</b> <b>and</b> Communications

The effective operation of free enterprise in
creating the envisioned information service industry 
is dependent upon three accomplishments: (1) the restructuring
of our information processing industry 
so that a clear division of costs is made among <b>computing</b>,
communications, <b>and</b> the development of information 
services; (2) the wide use of multiaccess system concepts
so that information services may share in the 
use of computer installations <b>and</b> so that the cost of their
construction is reasonable; <b>and</b> (3) the development 
of public, message-switched communications services so
that adequate provisions are made for information 
security<br><br><u><b>CACM-3082.html</b></u><br>



Time, Clocks, <b>and</b> the Ordering of Events in a <b>Distributed</b> System

The concept of one event happening before
another in a <b>distributed</b> system is examined, <b>and</b>
is shown to define a partial ordering of the events<br><br><u><b>CACM-2578.html</b></u><br>
