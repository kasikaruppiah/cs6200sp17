Merging with <b>Parallel</b> <b>Processors</b>

Consider two linearly ordered sets A, B, |A|=m,
|B|=n, m<=n, <b>and</b> p, p<=m, <b>parallel</b> <b>processors</b> 
working synchronously<br><br><u><b>CACM-3075.html</b></u><br>



Fast <b>Parallel</b> Sorting Algorithms

A <b>parallel</b> bucket-sort algorithm is presented
that requires time O(log n) <b>and</b> the use of n 
<b>processors</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-3156.html</b></u><br>



Computing Connected Components on <b>Parallel</b> Computers

We present a <b>parallel</b> algorithm which uses n2 <b>processors</b> to find the connected
components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time O(log2n)<br><br><u><b>CACM-2685.html</b></u><br>



The <b>Parallel</b> Execution of DO Loops

Methods are developed <b>for</b> the <b>parallel</b> execution
of different iterations of a DO loop<br><br><u><b>CACM-2175.html</b></u><br>  If the
number of subexpressions which can be executed in 
<b>parallel</b> exceeds the number of available <b>processors</b>,
then execution of some of these subexpressions must 
be postponed<br><br><u><b>CACM-1795.html</b></u><br>



Optimal <b>Code</b> <b>for</b> Serial <b>and</b> <b>Parallel</b> Computation

CACM December, 1969

Fateman, R<br><br><u><b>CACM-2896.html</b></u><br>  The fine degree of in terleaving
in this program makes it <b>especially</b> difficult 
to understand, <b>and</b> complicates the proof greatly<br><br><u><b>CACM-0950.html</b></u><br>



<b>Parallel</b> Methods <b>for</b> Integrating Ordinary Differential Equations

This paper is dedicated to the proposition that,
in order to take full advantage <b>for</b> real-time 
computations of <b>highly</b> <b>parallel</b> computers as can be
expected to be available in the near future, much 
of numerical analysis will have to be recast in a more
"<b>parallel</b>" form<br><br><u><b>CACM-2266.html</b></u><br>



A <b>Highly</b> <b>Parallel</b> Algorithm <b>for</b> Approximating
All Zeros of a Polynomial with Only Real Zeros

An algorithm is described based on Newton's
method which simultaneously approximates all zeros 
of a polynomial with only real zeros<br><br><u><b>CACM-1262.html</b></u><br>  These serve partly as brackets in establishing
a range of <b>parallel</b> operation <b>and</b> partly to 
define each <b>parallel</b> path within this range<br><br>
