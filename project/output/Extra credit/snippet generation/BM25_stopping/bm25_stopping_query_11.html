Automatic Data Structure Choice in a Language of <b>Very</b> <b>High</b> <b>Level</b>

<b>SETL</b> is a set-theoretically oriented language
of <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> whose repertoire of semantic 
objects includes finite sets, ordered n-tuples, and
sets of ordered n-tuples usable as mappings<br><br><u><b>CACM-1923.html</b></u><br>



Pseudofiles

An approach to system interfaces for <b>high</b>
<b>level</b> <b>languages</b> using basic input/output support 
facilities is described<br><br><u><b>CACM-3148.html</b></u><br>  This paper describes an approach
to distributed computing at the <b>level</b> of general purpose programming

CONVERT: A <b>High</b> <b>Level</b> Translation
Definition Language for Data Conversion

This paper describes a <b>high</b> <b>level</b> and nonprocedural
translation definition language, CONVERT, 
which provides <b>very</b> powerful and highly flexible data
restructuring capabilities<br><br><u><b>CACM-3150.html</b></u><br>  Just
as <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>languages</b> enabled the programmer to escape from the
intricacies of a machine's order code, higher <b>level</b> programming systems
can provide the means to understand and manipulate complex
systems and components<br><br><u><b>CACM-2906.html</b></u><br>
 In recent years, <b>very</b> <b>high</b>-<b>level</b> <b>languages</b> 
have been increasingly explored as a solution to this
problem<br><br><u><b>CACM-3171.html</b></u><br>



Line Numbers Made Cheap

A technique is described for run-time line number administration
to be used for implementations of <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>languages</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2527.html</b></u><br>



Implementation of <b>High</b> <b>Level</b> Language Machine

Computing machines which directly execute
the statements of a <b>high</b> <b>level</b> language have been 
proposed in the past<br><br><u><b>CACM-2316.html</b></u><br>



Programming <b>Languages</b>: History and Future

This paper discusses both the history and future
of programming <b>languages</b> (= higher <b>level</b> <b>languages</b>)<br><br><u><b>CACM-3077.html</b></u><br>  Combining forms can
use <b>high</b> <b>level</b> programs to build still higher <b>level</b>
ones in a style not possible in conventional <b>languages</b><br><br>
