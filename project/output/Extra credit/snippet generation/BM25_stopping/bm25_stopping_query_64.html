The Treatment of Data Types in <b>EL1</b>

In constructing a general purpose programming
language, a key issue is providing a sufficient 
set of data types <b>and</b> associated operations in a manner
that permits both natural problem-oriented notation 
<b>and</b> efficient implementation<br><br><u><b>CACM-1307.html</b></u><br>  Since such a person is
often unable to spend the time necessary to master 
a programming language, <b>it</b> is essential that he <b>be</b> aided
in composing commands to the computer<br><br><u><b>CACM-1717.html</b></u><br> The algorithm, which has 
been programmed in the FORTRAN language, generally requires
less memory than other minimization procedures, 
<b>and</b> treats <b>DON</b>'<b>T</b> CARE terms in an efficient manner<br><br><u><b>CACM-1046.html</b></u><br> <b>it</b> expands <b>on</b> some points that the original
authors cover briefly, <b>and</b> treats only very 
lightly some topics to which <b>they</b> devote considerable space<br><br><u><b>CACM-0397.html</b></u><br>, <b>it</b> 
is suitable <b>as</b> a standard for card reference files in information processing<br><br><u><b>CACM-2855.html</b></u><br>  The 
original <b>list</b> is destroyed <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is moved<br><br><u><b>CACM-2513.html</b></u><br>  The original <b>list</b> structure is destroyed <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is moved<br><br><u><b>CACM-0527.html</b></u><br>



The Description <b>List</b> of Concepts

A concept is defined <b>as</b> a class of objects
whose members can <b>be</b> distinguished by processing 
its properties<br><br><u><b>CACM-1853.html</b></u><br>  The system garbage collector
attempts to make <b>all</b> lists compact; <b>it</b> relocates 
<b>and</b> rearranges <b>all</b> of <b>list</b> storage using temporary storage<br><br><u><b>CACM-1972.html</b></u><br>



A  Nonrecursive <b>List</b> Compacting Algorithm 

A simple nonrecursive <b>list</b> structure compacting scheme or garbage 
collector suitable for both compact <b>and</b> LISP-like <b>list</b> structures is presented<br><br>
