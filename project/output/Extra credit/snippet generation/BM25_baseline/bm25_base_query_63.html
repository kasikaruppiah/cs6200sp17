Fast <b>Parallel</b> Sorting <b>Algorithms</b>

A <b>parallel</b> bucket-sort algorithm is presented
that requires time O(log n) <b>and</b> the use of n 
processors<br><br><u><b>CACM-2266.html</b></u><br>  The algorithm, which
is conceptually suitable <b>for</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>computation</b>, 
determines its own starting values so that convergence
to the zeros is guaranteed<br><br><u><b>CACM-1601.html</b></u><br>



<b>Parallel</b> Numerical Methods <b>for</b> the Solution of Equations

Classical iterative procedures <b>for</b> the numerical
solution of equations provide at each stage 
a single new approximation to the root in question<br><br><u><b>CACM-2557.html</b></u><br>



On the Time Required <b>for</b> a Sequence of Matrix Products

This paper discusses the multiplication of conformable
sequences of row vectors, column vectors, 
<b>and</b> square matrices<br><br><u><b>CACM-1468.html</b></u><br>  The <b>parallel</b> processing
simulator, originally written <b>for</b> an IBM 7094
system, has now been rewritten <b>for</b> a CDC 3600 system<br><br><u><b>CACM-2289.html</b></u><br>  A major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays <b>for</b> the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of <b>algorithms</b>
that exploit the possibilities <b>for</b> parallelism, 
<b>especially</b> <b>for</b> problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial<br><br><u><b>CACM-1158.html</b></u><br>



Program Structures <b>for</b> <b>Parallel</b> Processing

Constructs <b>for</b> organizing <b>and</b> explicating <b>parallel</b>
program segments are discussed as extensions 
to ALGOL 60<br><br><u><b>CACM-3156.html</b></u><br>  Simultaneous access to the same location
is permitted <b>for</b> fetch instructions but not <b>for</b> store instructions<br><br><u><b>CACM-0950.html</b></u><br>



<b>Parallel</b> Methods <b>for</b> Integrating Ordinary Differential Equations

This paper is dedicated to the proposition that,
in order to take full advantage <b>for</b> real-time 
computations of highly <b>parallel</b> computers as can be
expected to be available in the near future, much 
of numerical analysis will have to be recast in a more
"<b>parallel</b>" form<br><br>
