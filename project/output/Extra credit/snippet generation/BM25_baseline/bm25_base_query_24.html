and Transient States of a <b>Stochastic</b> Matrix

An algorithm for identifying the ergodic subchains
and transient states of a <b>stochastic</b> matrix

A <b>Stochastic</b> Evaluation Model for Database
Organization in Data Retrieval Systems

Experimental work in the valuation of large
scale data retrieval systems has been scarce due 
to its difficulty and prohibitive cost<br><br><u><b>CACM-1410.html</b></u><br>



Interarrival Statistics for Time Sharing Systems

The optimization of time-shared system performance
requires the description of the <b>stochastic</b> 
<b>processes</b> governing the user inputs and the program activity<br><br><u><b>CACM-1540.html</b></u><br>  The algorithm
is more <b>stochastic</b> than Monte Carlo in nature<br><br><u><b>CACM-1435.html</b></u><br> 
 The four experimental design problems are: (1) the
problem of <b>stochastic</b> convergence, (2) the problem 
of factor selection, (3) the problem of motive
and (4) the many response problem<br><br><u><b>CACM-2742.html</b></u><br>  This
problem may be attributed in part to difficulties 
such as slow <b>stochastic</b> convergence<br><br><u><b>CACM-1194.html</b></u><br>



Establishment of the ACM Repository and Principles
of the IR System <b>Applied</b> to its Operation

Degree of Multiprogramming in Page-on-Demand Systems

A simple <b>stochastic</b> model is described which
offers a base for understanding the relationship 
between the number of programs permitted to share memory
(the degree of multiprogramming), drum traffic 
rates, and central processing unit utilization in page-on-demand,
multiprogrammed, time-shared computer 
systems<br><br><u><b>CACM-0020.html</b></u><br>



Accelerating Convergence of Iterative <b>Processes</b>

A technique is discussed which, when <b>applied</b>
to an iterative procedure for the solution of
an equation, accelerates the rate of convergence if
the iteration converges and induces convergence if
the iteration diverges<br><br>
