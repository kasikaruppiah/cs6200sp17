Some Ideas <b>on</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Types</b> <b>in</b> High-Level <b>Languages</b>

A number of issues <b>are</b> explored concerning <b>the</b>
notion <b>that</b> a <b>data</b> <b>type</b> is a set of values together 
<b>with</b> a set of primitive operations <b>on</b> those values<br><br><u><b>CACM-1098.html</b></u><br>  Finally, <b>the</b> authors give 
some heuristics to aid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> selection of one of these
<b>languages</b> for use <b>in</b> particular problem applications, 
concluding <b>that</b> no one of <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> considered is
distinctly superior <b>in</b> <b>all</b> possible <b>list</b>-processing 
applications<br><br><u><b>CACM-2316.html</b></u><br>  <b>The</b> major <b>languages</b> <b>are</b> listed
<b>with</b> <b>the</b> reasons for their importance<br><br><u><b>CACM-2603.html</b></u><br>  <b>In</b> this paper this 
result is extended, showing <b>that</b>, <b>in</b> fact, <b>the</b> first class
is equivalent to <b>the</b> class of deterministic 
context free <b>languages</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-1366.html</b></u><br>



Computer Simulation-Discussion of <b>the</b>
Technique and Comparison of <b>Languages</b> 

<b>The</b> purpose of this paper is to present a comparison
of some computer simulation <b>languages</b> 
and of some of <b>the</b> involved <b>in</b> comparing software packages
for digital computers <b>are</b> discussed <b>in</b> Part 
<b>I</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2705.html</b></u><br>



Programming <b>Languages</b>, Natural <b>Languages</b>, and Mathematics

Some social aspects of programming <b>are</b> illuminated
through analogies <b>with</b> similar aspects of 
mathematics and natural <b>languages</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2941.html</b></u><br>
<b>The</b> specific topics addressed <b>are</b>: module structure 
and its use <b>in</b> defining abstractions, <b>data</b>-structuring
facilities <b>in</b> Mesa, an equivalence algorithm for 
<b>types</b> and <b>type</b> coercions, <b>the</b> benefits of <b>the</b> <b>type</b> system
and why it is breached occasionally, and <b>the</b> 
difficulty of making <b>the</b> treatment of variant records safe<br><br><u><b>CACM-1459.html</b></u><br>



Requirements for Real-Time <b>Languages</b>

Real-time <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> different requirements
from other programming <b>languages</b> because of 
<b>the</b> special nature of their applications, <b>the</b> environment
<b>in</b> which their object programs <b>are</b> executed 
and <b>the</b> environment <b>in</b> which they may be compiled<br><br><u><b>CACM-3105.html</b></u><br>
 <b>The</b> approach can be used to extend <b>any</b> strongly-typed 
language, but is particularly suitable for extending
<b>languages</b> <b>that</b> support <b>the</b> notion of abstract <b>data</b> 
<b>types</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-1485.html</b></u><br>  <b>The</b> advantages, disadvantages and
factors influencing <b>the</b> choice of a form of component 
for a language <b>are</b> discussed, and <b>the</b> paper concludes
<b>with</b> <b>the</b> suggestion <b>that</b> programming <b>languages</b> 
evolve toward one which will permit <b>all</b> <b>the</b> most convenient
ways of structuring programs, organizing 
systems and referencing <b>data</b><br><br>
