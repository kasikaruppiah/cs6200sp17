A Highly <b>Parallel</b> Algorithm <b>for</b> Approximating
All Zeros of a Polynomial with Only Real Zeros

An algorithm is described based on Newton'<b>s</b>
method which simultaneously approximates all zeros 
of a polynomial with only real zeros<br><br><u><b>CACM-3156.html</b></u><br>  Simultaneous access to the same location
is permitted <b>for</b> fetch instructions but not <b>for</b> store instructions<br><br><u><b>CACM-2401.html</b></u><br>

Verifying Properties of <b>Parallel</b> Programs: An Axiomatic Approach

An axiomatic method <b>for</b> proving a number
of properties of <b>parallel</b> programs is presented<br><br><u><b>CACM-2342.html</b></u><br>  Solutions have been given
<b>for</b> the mutual exclusion problem <b>and</b> associated 
subproblems, in the form of <b>parallel</b> programs, <b>and</b> informal
proofs of correctness have been given <b>for</b> 
these solutions<br><br><u><b>CACM-0950.html</b></u><br>



<b>Parallel</b> Methods <b>for</b> Integrating Ordinary Differential Equations

This paper is dedicated to the proposition that,
in order to take full advantage <b>for</b> real-time 
computations of highly <b>parallel</b> computers as can be
expected to be available in the near future, much 
of numerical analysis will have to be recast in a more
"<b>parallel</b>" form<br><br>
