Fast <b>Parallel</b> Sorting Algorithms

A <b>parallel</b> bucket-sort algorithm is presented
that requires time O(log n) <b>and</b> the use of n 
<b>processors</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2685.html</b></u><br>



The <b>Parallel</b> Execution of DO Loops

Methods are developed <b>for</b> the <b>parallel</b> execution
of different iterations of a DO loop<br><br><u><b>CACM-1795.html</b></u><br>

Merging with <b>Parallel</b> <b>Processors</b>

Consider two linearly ordered sets A, B, |A|=m,
|B|=n, m<=n, <b>and</b> p, p<=m, <b>parallel</b> <b>processors</b> 
working synchronously<br><br><u><b>CACM-1158.html</b></u><br>



Program Structures <b>for</b> <b>Parallel</b> Processing

Constructs <b>for</b> organizing <b>and</b> explicating <b>parallel</b>
program segments are discussed as extensions 
to ALGOL 60<br><br><u><b>CACM-3156.html</b></u><br>



Computing Connected Components on <b>Parallel</b> Computers

We present a <b>parallel</b> algorithm which uses n2 <b>processors</b> to find the connected
components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time O(log2n)<br><br><u><b>CACM-2896.html</b></u><br>  The fine degree of in terleaving
in this program makes it <b>especially</b> difficult 
to understand, <b>and</b> complicates the proof greatly<br><br><u><b>CACM-2723.html</b></u><br> Complete procedures <b>for</b> garbage 
collection <b>and</b> <b>for</b> standard list processing primitives
are presented <b>and</b> thoroughly explained<br><br><u><b>CACM-2570.html</b></u><br>



A Comparison of List Schedules <b>for</b> <b>Parallel</b> Processing Systems

The problem of scheduling two or more <b>processors</b>
to minimize the execution time of a program 
which consists of a set of partially ordered tasks
is studied<br><br><u><b>CACM-3059.html</b></u><br>

Application to CPU:I/O <b>and</b> I/O:I/O Overlap

Approximate queueing models <b>for</b> internal <b>parallel</b>
processing by individual programs in a multiprogrammed 
system are developed in this paper<br><br>
