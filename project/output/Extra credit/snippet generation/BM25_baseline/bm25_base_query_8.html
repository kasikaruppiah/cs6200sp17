Capability-Based <b>Addressing</b>

Various <b>addressing</b> <b>schemes</b> making use of segment
tables are examined<br><br><u><b>CACM-1869.html</b></u><br>  However, when indirect
<b>addressing</b> is used, as <b>in</b> SNOBOL, naming constraints 
may be introduced<br><br><u><b>CACM-0912.html</b></u><br>

A Process <b>for</b> the Determination of
Addresses <b>in</b> Variable Length <b>Addressing</b>

An algorithm is presented <b>for</b> the assignment
of instruction addresses and formats under the 
following conditions: (1) the length of the instruction varies
as a function of the distance of the instruction 
from its target; (2) there exists an optimality criterion
which implies some preferential choices subject 
to the <b>addressing</b> constraints<br><br><u><b>CACM-2991.html</b></u><br>  Shadow buckets <b>in</b> the key search sequence 
reduce the effect of nonuniformity <b>in</b> file loading,
and decrease the number of maximum probes needed 
to locate a record<br><br><u><b>CACM-2541.html</b></u><br>  It also suggested an important
new concept <b>for</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b>: separation 
of the scheduling from the maintenance functions <b>in</b> <b>resource</b>
allocation<br><br><u><b>CACM-2194.html</b></u><br> <b>For</b> example,
some computers permit either 8-bit <b>addressing</b> 
(interpreted relative to the location counter) or full
16-bit <b>addressing</b> of all of memory<br><br><u><b>CACM-1785.html</b></u><br>



Scatter Storage Techniques

Scatter storage techniques as a method <b>for</b>
implementing the symbol tables of assemblers and 
compilers are reviewed and a number of ways of using
them more effectively are presented<br><br><u><b>CACM-3083.html</b></u><br>  It owes
its name to the fact that link fields are present 
<b>in</b> each cell of the hash table which permits "chaining"
of the first overflow items <b>in</b> the table<br><br><u><b>CACM-3032.html</b></u><br>
 The algorithm is described as being practical 
 because it is not optimal according to metrics developed
<b>for</b> its analysis <b>in</b> this paper, and also because 
it can be implemented <b>in</b> existing <b>networks</b> with less complexity
than that required <b>for</b> the known alternatives<br><br>
