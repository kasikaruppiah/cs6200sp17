A Model <b>of</b> <b>Memory</b> Contention in a Paging Machine

This paper is concerned with certain <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> contention
for main <b>memory</b> resources in a multiprogrammed 
computer system <b>operating</b> under demand paging<br><br><u><b>CACM-2988.html</b></u><br>



<b>Memory</b> <b>Management</b> and Response Time

This paper presents a computationally tractable
methodology for including accurately the effects 
<b>of</b> finite <b>memory</b> size and workload <b>memory</b> requirements
in queueing network models <b>of</b> computer <b>systems</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2358.html</b></u><br> 
Since the size <b>of</b> main <b>memory</b> on contemporary <b>systems</b> 
is rather limited, it is then shown how the Multics
software achieves the effect <b>of</b> a large segmented 
main <b>memory</b> through the use <b>of</b> the Honeywell
645 segmentation and paging hardware<br><br><u><b>CACM-1752.html</b></u><br>  A synopsis is given 
<b>of</b> the task scheduling and paging algorithms that were implemented,
and the results <b>of</b> comparative simulation 
are given by tracing the development <b>of</b> the algorithms
through six predecessor versions<br><br><u><b>CACM-2902.html</b></u><br>  Algorithm performance was measured in
terms <b>of</b> processing time, <b>memory</b> usage, and external <b>memory</b>
fragmentation<br><br><u><b>CACM-3006.html</b></u><br>



Anomalies with Variable Partition Paging Algorithms

Five types <b>of</b> anomalous behavior which may
occur in paged virtual <b>memory</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b>

Analysis <b>of</b> Interleaved <b>Memory</b> <b>Systems</b> Using Blockage Buffers

A model <b>of</b> interleaved <b>memory</b> <b>systems</b> is presented,
and the analysis <b>of</b> the model by Monte 
Carlo simulation is discussed<br><br><u><b>CACM-2669.html</b></u><br>  The simple
model combines the effect <b>of</b> the information 
reference pattern with the effect <b>of</b> the automatic <b>management</b>
algorithm to produce a single, composite 
statement: the mean number <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> references between
paging exceptions increases linearly with the 
size <b>of</b> the paging <b>memory</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-1901.html</b></u><br>



Dynamic Space-Sharing in Computer <b>Systems</b>

A formalization <b>of</b> relationships between space-shading
program behavior, and processor efficiency 
in computer <b>systems</b> is presented<br><br><u><b>CACM-1892.html</b></u><br>



Degree <b>of</b> Multiprogramming in Page-on-Demand <b>Systems</b>

A simple stochastic model is described which
offers a base for understanding the relationship 
between the number <b>of</b> programs permitted to share <b>memory</b>
(the degree <b>of</b> multiprogramming), drum traffic 
rates, and central processing unit utilization in page-on-demand,
multiprogrammed, time-shared computer
