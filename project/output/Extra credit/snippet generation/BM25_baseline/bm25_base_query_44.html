 This paper describes extensions <b>of</b> this algorithm in
the areas <b>of</b> <b>texture</b> simulation and lighting models<br><br><u><b>CACM-2523.html</b></u><br>  The resulting map is cleaned 
<b>by</b> comparing the region colors with the textures <b>of</b>
the corresponding regions in the picture, and also 
<b>by</b> merging some regions with others according to criteria
based on topology and size<br><br><u><b>CACM-2325.html</b></u><br>  These are: foundations
(finite precision number systems, computational 
complexity), <b>synthesis</b> and <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> algorithms,
<b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> error, programs and program libraries<br><br><u><b>CACM-2771.html</b></u><br>



The <b>Synthesis</b> <b>of</b> Solids Bounded <b>by</b> Many Faces

A technique is presented which allows a class
<b>of</b> solid objects to be synthesized and stored 
using a <b>computer</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2494.html</b></u><br>  A well-known set <b>of</b> data 
consisting <b>of</b> the correlations <b>of</b> 24 psychological tests
is used to illustrate the comparison <b>of</b> groupings 
<b>by</b> four methods <b>of</b> factor <b>analysis</b> and two methods <b>of</b> cluster <b>analysis</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-1002.html</b></u><br>



A Rapid Method for Digital Filtering

Since much <b>of</b> the <b>computer</b> time spent in time-series
<b>analysis</b> is used for multiplications, 
a minimum multiplication method was devised for digital
filtering, with the expectation that it would 
be useful in the on line, real-time <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> biological
data<br><br><u><b>CACM-2751.html</b></u><br>



Illumination for <b>Computer</b> Generated Pictures

The quality <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> generated images <b>of</b>
three-dimensional scenes depends on the shading 
technique used to paint the objects on the cathode-ray
tube screen<br><br><u><b>CACM-1260.html</b></u><br>  <b>By</b> using the 
cut step procedure for convergence and <b>by</b> imposing physical
constraints on the functional form <b>of</b> the 
calculation it is possible to make the <b>analysis</b> on a
small <b>computer</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-0533.html</b></u><br>  In order to 
simplify discussion <b>of</b> the statistical properties <b>of</b> the
noise generated, the technique is first presented 
in terms <b>of</b> exact harmonic <b>analysis</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-1686.html</b></u><br>
