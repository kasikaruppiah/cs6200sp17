describe a series <b>of</b> experiments for <b>testing</b> the 
validity <b>of</b> these models<br><br><u><b>CACM-3175.html</b></u><br>



Breaking Substitution Ciphers Using a Relaxation <b>Algorithm</b>

Substitution ciphers are codes in which each letter
<b>of</b> the alphabet has one fixed substitute, <b>and</b> the word divisions 
do not change<br><br><u><b>CACM-2681.html</b></u><br>



Dynamic Memory Repacking

A <b>probabilistic</b> model <b>of</b> a multiprogramming system
is exercised in order to determine the conditions 
under which the dynamic repacking <b>of</b> main memory is beneficial<br><br><u><b>CACM-1935.html</b></u><br>



Randomized Binary Search Technique

A mathematical model is developed for the mean

A Queuing Model <b>of</b> a Multiprogrammed
Computer <b>with</b> a Two-Level Storage System

The results are presented <b>of</b> an analysis <b>of</b>
a <b>probabilistic</b> model <b>of</b> a multiprogrammed computer 
system <b>with</b> a two-level storage system in which there
is sequential dependency <b>of</b> accesses between the 
devices<br><br><u><b>CACM-2516.html</b></u><br>  The data storage
hardware is assumed to consist <b>on</b> n-levels <b>of</b> 
linearly connected memory hardware <b>with</b> increasing data
access times <b>and</b> increasing data storage capabilities<br><br><u><b>CACM-2580.html</b></u><br>  Fundamental to the
method is a set <b>of</b> productions together <b>with</b> sets 
<b>of</b> applicability rules <b>and</b> weight rules which operate
<b>on</b> the productions deciding when <b>and</b> to what extent 
they are available for use<br><br><u><b>CACM-2437.html</b></u><br>  All files <b>with</b> the same number <b>of</b> 
keys selected from this key space will be suitably weighted
in accordance <b>with</b> the <b>algorithm</b>, <b>and</b> the 
average performance <b>of</b> the transformation methods <b>on</b>
these files will be used as the potential <b>of</b> these 
methods<br><br>
