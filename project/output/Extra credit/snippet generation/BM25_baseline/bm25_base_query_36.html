An Efficient <b>Context-free</b> <b>Parsing</b> <b>Algorithm</b>

A <b>parsing</b> <b>algorithm</b> which seems to be the most efficient general <b>context-free</b> 
<b>algorithm</b> known is described<br><br><u><b>CACM-1265.html</b></u><br>



On the Relative Efficiencies of <b>Context-Free</b> Grammar Recognizers

A number of diverse <b>recognition</b> procedures
that have been proposed <b>for</b> <b>parsing</b> sentences with 
respect to a <b>context-free</b> grammar are described in this
paper by means of a common device<br><br><u><b>CACM-2112.html</b></u><br>



Translation Equations

Input limited transduction expressions, <b>or</b> translation equations,
are used to describe the syntax and left-context sensitive semantics <b>for</b> 
<b>context-free</b> languages<br><br><u><b>CACM-2698.html</b></u><br>
 <b>Recognition</b> consists of a least-errors count <b>for</b> 
a corrected version of the input relative to the driver
grammar<br><br><u><b>CACM-1350.html</b></u><br>  In section
2, the augmented predictive analyzer as a <b>parsing</b> 
<b>algorithm</b> <b>for</b> arbitrary <b>context-free</b> languages is compared
with two other <b>parsing</b> algorithms: a selective 
top-to-bottom <b>algorithm</b> similar to Irons' "error correcting
parse <b>algorithm</b>" and an immediate constituent 
analyzer which is an extension of Sakai-Cocke's <b>algorithm</b>
<b>for</b> normal grammars<br><br><u><b>CACM-2739.html</b></u><br>



The Restriction <b>Language</b> <b>for</b> Computer Grammars of Natural <b>Language</b>

Over the past few years, a number of systems
<b>for</b> the computer analysis of natural <b>language</b> 
sentences have been based on augmented <b>context-free</b>
grammars: a <b>context-free</b> grammar which defines a 
set of parse trees <b>for</b> a sentence, plus a group of restrictions
to which a tree must conform in order 
to be a valid sentence analysis<br><br><u><b>CACM-2061.html</b></u><br>



An <b>Algorithm</b> <b>for</b> the Construction Of Bounded-Context Parsers

An <b>algorithm</b> is described which accepts an arbitrary <b>context-free</b>
grammar and constructs a bounded-context parser <b>for</b>
it whenever such a parser exists<br><br><u><b>CACM-1787.html</b></u><br>



Use of Transition Matrices in Compiling

An algorithms is described which constructs
from a suitable BNF grammar an efficient left-right 
recognizer <b>for</b> sentences of the corresponding <b>language</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-1012.html</b></u><br>



Formal <b>Parsing</b> Systems

Automatic syntactic analysis has recently become
important <b>for</b> both natural <b>language</b> data processing 
and syntax-directed compilers<br><br><u><b>CACM-2030.html</b></u><br>
