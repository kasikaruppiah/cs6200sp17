Fast <b>Parallel</b> Sorting <b>Algorithms</b>

A <b>parallel</b> bucket-sort algorithm is presented
that requires time O(log n) and the use of n 
processors<br><br><u><b>CACM-2266.html</b></u><br>

Computing Connected Components on <b>Parallel</b> Computers

We present a <b>parallel</b> algorithm which uses n2 processors to find the connected
components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time O(log2n)<br><br><u><b>CACM-0950.html</b></u><br>



<b>Parallel</b> Methods for Integrating Ordinary Differential Equations

This paper is dedicated to the proposition that,
in order to take full advantage for real-time 
computations of highly <b>parallel</b> computers as can be
expected to be available in the near future, much 
of numerical analysis will have to be recast in a more
"<b>parallel</b>" form<br><br><u><b>CACM-2557.html</b></u><br>  <b>Algorithms</b>
are presented which properly parse such matrix 
sequences subject to the constraints of the machine organization<br><br><u><b>CACM-1468.html</b></u><br>
