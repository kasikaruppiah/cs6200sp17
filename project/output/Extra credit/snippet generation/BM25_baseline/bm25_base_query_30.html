Description of FORMAT, a <b>Text</b>-Processing Program

FORMAT <b>is</b> a production program which facilitates
the editing and printing of "finished" documents 
directly <b>on</b> the printer of a relatively small (64k) computer
system<br><br><u><b>CACM-2341.html</b></u><br>  A variety of graphical problems (<b>including</b>
flowcharting, bargraphs, logic diagrams, 
mathematical-equation formation, and <b>text</b> justification
and preparation) have been programmed <b>on</b> a printer 
in <b>what</b> appears to be an easy and natural way<br><br><u><b>CACM-0248.html</b></u><br>



<b>What</b> <b>is</b> Proprietary In Mathematical Programming?-Impressions
of a Panel Discussion

A panel discussion <b>on</b> "<b>What</b> <b>is</b> Proprietary
in Mathematical Programming?" was sponsored by the 
Special Interest Committee <b>on</b> Mathematical Programming
of the ACM during a Hall of Discussion/<b>on</b> September 
7th at the 16th National ACM meeting in Los Angeles<br><br><u><b>CACM-2786.html</b></u><br>  The system 
interfaces directly with <b>text</b> <b>formatting</b> programs, so

<b>On</b> the Automatic Simplification of Computer Programs

Presented in this paper <b>is</b> the problem of writing
a program which would examine any other program 
and perform such simplifications <b>on</b> it as can be detected
from the argument-program's form alone, without 
having any knowledge of <b>what</b> it <b>is</b> supposed to do<br><br><u><b>CACM-2876.html</b></u><br>



Intentional Resolution of Privacy Protection in Database <b>Systems</b>

Traditionally, privacy protection in database
