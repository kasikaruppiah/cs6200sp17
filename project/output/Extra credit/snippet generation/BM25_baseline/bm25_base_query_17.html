Object <b>code</b> <b>Optimization</b>

Methods <b>of</b> analyzing the control flow <b>and</b> data
flow <b>of</b> programs during compilation are applied 
to transforming the program to improve object time efficiency<br><br><u><b>CACM-1223.html</b></u><br>
 <b>Optimization</b> such as the effective use <b>of</b> index 
registers, although as important, is not discussed since
the object <b>code</b> which would be most efficient 
is highly <b>machine</b> dependent<br><br><u><b>CACM-3080.html</b></u><br>  The examples demonstrate 
that <b>optimization</b> <b>of</b> the genre <b>of</b> this paper can result
in substantially faster operation <b>and</b> the saving 
<b>of</b> memory in terms <b>of</b> program <b>and</b> stack sizes<br><br><u><b>CACM-1658.html</b></u><br>  The <b>machine</b> time <b>and</b> storage 
requirements <b>of</b> several <b>of</b> the algorithms are compared
over several test problems <b>of</b> small <b>and</b> <b>intermediate</b> 
size<br><br><u><b>CACM-2897.html</b></u><br> 
 Such a compiler translates the parsed source <b>code</b> into
lower level <b>code</b> by a sequence <b>of</b> steps<br><br><u><b>CACM-2253.html</b></u><br>  This scheme attempts program <b>optimization</b>
by transforming the original algorithm 
rather than the <b>machine</b> <b>code</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2491.html</b></u><br>



Threaded <b>Code</b>

The concept <b>of</b> "threaded <b>code</b>" is presented as
an alternative to <b>machine</b> language <b>code</b><br><br><u><b>CACM-2495.html</b></u><br>
